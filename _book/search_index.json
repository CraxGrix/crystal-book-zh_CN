编程语言\nThis is the language reference for the Crystal programming language.\nCrystal is a programming language with the following goals:\n\nHave a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal).\nBe statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.\nBe able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.\nHave compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.\nCompile to efficient native code.\n\nCrystal's standard library is documented in the API docs.\nContributing to the Language Reference\nDo you consider yourself a helpful person? If you find bugs or sections\nwhich need more clarification you're welcome to contribute to this\nlanguage reference. You can submit a pull request to this repository:\nhttps://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-book\nThank you very much!\n"},"using_the_compiler/":{"url":"using_the_compiler/","title":"Using the compiler","keywords":"","body":"Using the compiler\nOnce installed, the Crystal compiler should be available as crystal command.\nCompiling and running at once\nTo compile and run a program in a single shot, invoke crystal run with a single filename:\n$ echo 'puts \"Hello World!\"' > hello_world.cr\n$ crystal run hello_world.cr\nHello World!\n\nThe run command compiles the source file hello_world.cr to a binary executable in a temporary location\nand immediately executes it.\nCreating an executable\nThe crystal build command builds a binary executable.\nThe output file has the same name as the source file minus the extension .cr.\n$ crystal build hello_world.cr\n$ ./hello_world\nHello World!\n\nRelease builds\nBy default, the generated executables are not fully optimized. The --release flag can be used to enable optimizations.\n$ crystal build hello_world.cr --release\nCompiling without release mode is much faster and the resulting binaries still offer pretty good performance.\nBuilding in release mode should be used for production-ready executables and when performing benchmarks.\nFor simple development builds, there is usually no reason to do so.\nTo reduce the binary size for distributable files, the --no-debug flag can be used. This removes debug symbols reducing file size, but obviously making debugging more difficult.\nCreating a statically-linked executable\nThe --static flag can be used to build a statically-linked executable:\n$ crystal build hello_world.cr --release --static\nNOTE: Building fully statical linked executables is currently only supported on Alpine Linux.\nMore information about statically linking can be found on the wiki.\nThe compiler uses the CRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as a first lookup destination for static and dynamic libraries that are to be linked. This can be used to provide static versions of libraries that are also available as dynamic libraries.\nCreating a Crystal project\nThe crystal init command helps to initialize a Crystal project folder, setting\nup a basic project structure. crystal init app  is used for an application,\ncrystal init lib  for a library.\n$ crystal init app myapp\n    create  myapp/.gitignore\n    create  myapp/.editorconfig\n    create  myapp/LICENSE\n    create  myapp/README.md\n    create  myapp/.travis.yml\n    create  myapp/shard.yml\n    create  myapp/src/myapp.cr\n    create  myapp/src/myapp/version.cr\n    create  myapp/spec/spec_helper.cr\n    create  myapp/spec/myapp_spec.cr\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/crystal/myapp/.git/\n\nNot all of these files are required for every project, and some might need more customization, but crystal init creates a good default environment for developing Crystal applications and libraries.\nCompiler commands\n\ncrystal init: generate a new project\ncrystal build: build an executable\ncrystal docs: generate documentation\ncrystal env: print Crystal environment information\ncrystal eval: eval code from args or standard input\ncrystal play: starts crystal playground server\ncrystal run: build and run program\ncrystal spec: build and run specs\ncrystal tool: run a compiler tool\ncrystal help: show help about commands and options\ncrystal version: show version\n\nTo see the available options for a particular command, use --help after a command:\ncrystal run\nThe run command compiles a source file to a binary executable and immediately runs it.\ncrystal [run] []  [-- ...]\nArguments to the compiled binary can be separated with double dash -- from the compiler arguments.\nThe binary executable is stored in a temporary location between compiling and running.\nExample:\n$ echo 'puts \"Hello #{ARGV[0]?}!\"' > hello_world.cr\n$ crystal run hello_world.cr -- Crystal\nHello Crystal!\n\nCommon options:\n\n--release: Compile in release mode, doing extra work to apply optimizations to the generated code.\n--progress: Show progress during compilation.\n--static: Link statically.\n\nMore options are described in the integrated help: crystal run --help or man page man crystal.\ncrystal build\nThe crystal build command builds a dynamically-linked binary executable.\ncrystal build [] \nUnless specified, the resuling binary will have the same name as the source file minus the extension .cr.\nExample:\n$ echo 'puts \"Hello #{ARGV[0]?}!\"' > hello_world.cr\n$ crystal build hello_world.cr\n$ ./hello_world Crystal\nHello Crystal!\n\nCommon options:\n\n--cross-compile: Generate a .o file, and print the command to generate an executable to stdout.\n-D FLAG, --define FLAG: Define a compile-time flag.\n-o : Define the name of the binary executable.\n--release: Compile in release mode, doing extra work to apply optimizations to the generated code.\n--link-flags FLAGS: Additional flags to passs to the linker.\n--lto=thin: Use ThinLTO, improving performance on release builds.\n--no-debug: Skip any symbolic debug info, reducing the output file size.\n--progress: Show progress during compilation.\n--static: Link statically.\n--verbose: Display executed commands.\n\nMore options are described in the integrated help: crystal build --help or man page man crystal.\ncrystal eval\nThe crystal eval command reads Crystal source code from command line or stdin, compiles it to a binary executable and immediately runs it.\ncrystal eval [] []\nIf no source argument is provided, the Crystal source is read from standard input. The binary executable is stored in a temporary location between compiling and running.\nExample:\n$ crystal eval 'puts \"Hello World\"'\nHello World!\n$ echo 'puts \"Hello World\"' | crystal eval\nHello World!\n\nNOTE: When running interactively, stdin can usually be closed by typing the end of transmission character (Ctrl+D).\nCommon options:\n\n-o : Define the name of the binary executable.\n--release: Compile in release mode, doing extra work to apply optimizations to the generated code.\n--lto=thin: Use ThinLTO, improves performance.\n--no-debug: Skip any symbolic debug info, reducing the output file size.\n--progress: Show progress during compilation.\n--static: Link statically.\n\nMore options are described in the integrated help: crystal build --help or man page man crystal.\ncrystal version\nThe crystal version command prints the Crystal version, LLVM version and default target triple.\ncrystal version\nExample:\n$ crystal version\nCrystal 0.25.1 [b782738ff] (2018-06-27)\n\nLLVM: 4.0.0\nDefault target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n\ncrystal init\nThe crystal init command initializes a Crystal project folder.\ncrystal init (lib|app)  []\n\nThe first argument is either lib or app. A lib is a reusable library whereas app describes\nan application not intended to be used as a dependency. A library doesn't have a shard.lock file\nin its repository and no build target in shard.yml, but instructions for using it as a dependency.\nExample:\n$ crystal init lib my_cool_lib\n    create  my_cool_lib/.gitignore\n    create  my_cool_lib/.editorconfig\n    create  my_cool_lib/LICENSE\n    create  my_cool_lib/README.md\n    create  my_cool_lib/.travis.yml\n    create  my_cool_lib/shard.yml\n    create  my_cool_lib/src/my_cool_lib.cr\n    create  my_cool_lib/spec/spec_helper.cr\n    create  my_cool_lib/spec/my_cool_lib_spec.cr\nInitialized empty Git repository in ~/my_cool_lib/.git/\n\ncrystal docs\nThe crystal docs command generates API documentation from inline docstrings in Crystal files (see documenting code).\ncrystal docs [--output=] [--canonical-base-url=] [...]\n\nThe command creates a static website in output_dir (default ./docs), consisting of HTML files for each Crystal type,\nin a folder structure mirroring the Crystal namespaces. The entrypoint docs/index.html can be opened by any web browser.\nThe entire API docs are also stored as a JSON document in $output_dir/index.json.\nBy default, all Crystal files in ./src will be appended (i.e. src/**/*.cr).\nIn order to account for load-order dependencies, source_file can be used to specify one (or multiple)\nentrypoints for the docs generator.\ncrystal docs src/my_app.cr\n\nCommon options:\n\n--output=DIR, -o DIR: Set the output directory (default: ./docs)\n--canonical-base-url=URL, -b URL: Set the canonical base url\n\nFor the above example to output the docs at public with custom canonical base url, and entrypoint src/my_app.cr,\nthe following arguments can be used:\ncrystal docs --output public --canonical-base-url http://example.com/ src/my_app.cr\n\ncrystal env\nThe crystal env command prints environment variables used by Crystal.\ncrystal env [...]\n\nBy default, it prints information as a shell script. If one or more var arguments are provided,\nthe value of each named variable is printed on its own line.\nExample:\n$ crystal env\nCRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR=\"/home/crystal/.cache/crystal\"\nCRYSTAL_PATH=\"/usr/bin/../share/crystal/src:lib\"\nCRYSTAL_VERSION=\"0.28.0\"\nCRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/bin/../lib/crystal/lib\"\n$ crystal env CRYSTAL_VERSION\n0.28.0\n\ncrystal spec\nThe crystal spec command compiles and runs a Crystal spec suite.\ncrystal spec [] [...] [-- []]\nAll files arguments are concatenated into a single Crystal source. If an argument points to a folder, all spec\nfiles inside that folder are appended. If no files argument is provided, the default is ./spec. A filename can be suffixed by :\nand a line number, providing this location to the --location runner option (see below).\nRun crystal spec --options for available options.\nRunner options:\nrunner_options are provided to the compiled binary executable which runs the specs. They should be separated from\nthe other arguments by a double dash (--).\n\n--verbose: Prints verbose output, including all example names.\n--profile: Prints the 10 slowest specs.\n--fail-fast: Abort the spec run on first failure.\n--junit_output : Generates JUnit XML output.\n\nThe following options can be combined to filter the list of specs to run.\n\n--example : Runs examples whose full nested names include name.\n--line : Runs examples whose line matches line.\n--location :: Runs example(s) at line in file (multiple options allowed).\n--tag : Runs examples with the specified tag, or excludes examples by adding ~ before the tag (multiple options allowed).\n--tag a --tag b will include specs tagged with a OR b.\n--tag ~a --tag ~b will include specs not tagged with a AND not tagged with b.\n--tag a --tag ~b will include specs tagged with a, but not tagged with b\n\n\n\nExample:\n$ crystal spec\nF\n\nFailures:\n\n  1) Myapp works\n     Failure/Error: false.should eq(true)\n\n       Expected: true\n            got: false\n\n     # spec/myapp_spec.cr:7\n\nFinished in 880 microseconds\n1 examples, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 pending\n\nFailed examples:\n\ncrystal spec spec/myapp_spec.cr:6 # Myapp works\n\ncrystal play\nThe crystal play command starts a webserver serving an interactive Crystal playground.\ncrystal play [--port ] [--binding ] [--verbose] [file]\n\ncrystal tool\n\ncrystal tool context: Show context for given location\ncrystal tool expand: Show macro expansion for given location\ncrystal tool format: Format Crystal files\ncrystal tool hierarchy: Show type hierarchy\ncrystal tool implementations: Show implementations for given call in location\ncrystal tool types: Show types of main variables\n\ncrystal tool format\nThe crystal tool format command applies default format to Crystal source files.\ncrystal tool format [--check] [...]\npath can be a file or folder name and include all Crystal files in that folder tree. Omitting path is equal to\nspecifying the current working directory.\nEnvironment variables\nThe following environment variables are used by the Crystal compiler if set in the environment. Otherwise the compiler will populate them with default values. Their values can be inspected using crystal env.\n\nCRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR: Defines path where Crystal caches partial compilation results for faster subsequent builds. This path is also used to temporarily store executables when Crystal programs are run with crystal run rather than crystal build.\nDefault value is the first directory that either exists or can be created of ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/crystal (if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined), ${HOME}/.cache/crystal, ${HOME}/.crystal, ./.crystal. If CRYSTAL_CACHE_DIR is set but points to a path that is not writeable, the default values are used instead.\nCRYSTAL_PATH: Defines paths where Crystal searches for required files.\nCRYSTAL_VERSION is only available as output of crystal env. The compiler neither sets nor reads it.\nCRYSTAL_LIBRARY_PATH: The compiler uses the paths in this variable as a first lookup destination for static and dynamic libraries that are to be linked.

Alternatively, a separate shards package may be available for your system.\nTo install from source, download or clone the repository and run make CRFLAGS=--release. The compiled binary is in bin/shards and should be added to PATH.\nUsage\nshards requires the presence of a shard.yml file in the project folder (working directory). This file describes the project and lists dependencies that are required to build it.\nA default file can be created by running shards init.\nThe file's contents are explained in the Writing a Shard guide and a detailed description of the file format is provided by the shard.yml specification.\nRunning shards install resolves and installs the specified dependencies.\nThe installed versions are written into a shard.lock file for using the exact same dependency versions when running shards install again.\nIf your shard builds an application, both shard.yml and shard.lock should be checked into version control to provide reproducible dependency installs.\nIf it is only a library for other shards to depend on, shard.lock should not be checked in, only shard.yml.

So let’s have some fun building our first CLI application in Crystal.\nThere are two main topics when building a CLI application:\n\ninput\noutput\n\nInput\nThis topic covers all things related to:\n\noptions passed to the app\nrequest for user input\n\nOptions\nIt is a very common practice to pass options to the application. For example, we may run crystal -v and Crystal will display:\n$ crystal -v\nCrystal 0.31.1 (2019-10-02)\n\nLLVM: 8.0.1\nDefault target: x86_64-apple-macosx\n\nand if we run: crystal -h, then Crystal will show all the accepted options and how to use them.\nSo now the question would be: do we need to implement an options parser? No need to, Crystal got us covered with the class OptionParser. Let’s build an application using this parser!\nAt start our CLI application will have two options:\n\n-v / --version: it will display the application version.\n-h / --help: it will display the application help.\n\n# file: help.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\nOptionParser.parse do |parser|\n  parser.banner = \"Welcome to The Beatles App!\"\n\n  parser.on \"-v\", \"--version\", \"Show version\" do\n    puts \"version 1.0\"\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-h\", \"--help\", \"Show help\" do\n    puts parser\n    exit\n  end\nend\n\nSo, how does all this work? Well … magic! No, it’s not really magic! Just Crystal making our life easy.\nWhen our application starts, the block passed to OptionParser#parse gets executed. In that block we define all the options. After the block is executed, the parser will start consuming the arguments passed to the application, trying to match each one with the options defined by us. If an option matches then the block passed to parser#on gets executed!\nWe can read all about OptionParser in the official API documentation. And from there we are one click away from the source code ... the actual proof that it is not magic!\nNow, let's run our application. We have two ways using the compiler:\n\nBuild the application and then run it.\nCompile and run the application, all in one command.\n\nWe are going to use the second way:\n$ crystal ./help.cr -- -h\n\nWelcome to The Beatles App!\n    -v, --version                    Show version\n    -h, --help                       Show help\n\nLet's build another fabulous application with the following feature:\nBy default (i.e. no options given) the application will display the names of the Fab Four. But, if we pass the option -t / --twist it will display the names in uppercase:\n# file: twist_and_shout.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\nthe_beatles = [\n  \"John Lennon\",\n  \"Paul McCartney\",\n  \"George Harrison\",\n  \"Ringo Starr\"\n]\nshout = false\n\noption_parser = OptionParser.parse do |parser|\n  parser.banner = \"Welcome to The Beatles App!\"\n\n  parser.on \"-v\", \"--version\", \"Show version\" do\n    puts \"version 1.0\"\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-h\", \"--help\", \"Show help\" do\n    puts parser\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-t\", \"--twist\", \"Twist and SHOUT\" do\n    shout = true\n  end\nend\n\nmembers = the_beatles\nmembers = the_beatles.map &.upcase if shout\n\nputs \"\"\nputs \"Group members:\"\nputs \"==============\"\nmembers.each do |member|\n  puts member\nend\n\nRunning the application with the -t option will output:\n$ crystal run ./twist_and_shout.cr -- -t\n\nGroup members:\n==============\nJOHN LENNON\nPAUL MCCARTNEY\nGEORGE HARRISON\nRINGO STARR\n\nParameterized options\nLet’s create another application: when passing the option -g / --goodbye_hello, the application will say hello to a given name passed as a parameter to the option.\n# file: hello_goodbye.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\nthe_beatles = [\n  \"John Lennon\",\n  \"Paul McCartney\",\n  \"George Harrison\",\n  \"Ringo Starr\"\n]\nsay_hi_to = \"\"\n\noption_parser = OptionParser.parse do |parser|\n  parser.banner = \"Welcome to The Beatles App!\"\n\n  parser.on \"-v\", \"--version\", \"Show version\" do\n    puts \"version 1.0\"\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-h\", \"--help\", \"Show help\" do\n    puts parser\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-g NAME\", \"--goodbye_hello=NAME\", \"Say hello to whoever you want\" do |name|\n    say_hi_to = name\n  end\nend\n\nunless say_hi_to.empty?\n  puts \"\"\n  puts \"You say goodbye, and #{the_beatles[Random.new.rand(4)]} says hello to #{say_hi_to}!\"\nend\n\nIn this case, the block receives a parameter that represents the parameter passed to the option.\nLet’s try it!\n$ crystal ./hello_goodbye.cr -- -g \"Penny Lane\"\n\nYou say goodbye, and Ringo Starr say hello to Penny Lane!\n\nGreat! These applications look awesome! But, what happens when we pass an option that is not declared? For example -n\n$ crystal ./hello_goodbye.cr -- -n\nUnhandled exception: Invalid option: -n (OptionParser::InvalidOption)\n  from ...\n\nOh no! It’s broken: we need to handle invalid options and invalid parameters given to an option! For these two situations, the OptionParser class has two methods: #invalid_option and #missing_option\nSo, let's add this option handlers and merge all this CLI applications into one fabulous CLI application!\nAll My CLI: The complete application!\nHere’s the final result, with invalid/missing options handling, plus other new options:\n# file: all_my_cli.cr\nrequire \"option_parser\"\n\nthe_beatles = [\n  \"John Lennon\",\n  \"Paul McCartney\",\n  \"George Harrison\",\n  \"Ringo Starr\"\n]\nshout = false\nsay_hi_to = \"\"\nstrawberry = false\n\noption_parser = OptionParser.parse do |parser|\n  parser.banner = \"Welcome to The Beatles App!\"\n\n  parser.on \"-v\", \"--version\", \"Show version\" do\n    puts \"version 1.0\"\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-h\", \"--help\", \"Show help\" do\n    puts parser\n    exit\n  end\n  parser.on \"-t\", \"--twist\", \"Twist and SHOUT\" do\n    shout = true\n  end\n  parser.on \"-g NAME\", \"--goodbye_hello=NAME\", \"Say hello to whoever you want\" do |name|\n    say_hi_to = name\n  end\n  parser.on \"-r\", \"--random_goodbye_hello\", \"Say hello to one random member\" do\n    say_hi_to = the_beatles[Random.new.rand(4)]\n  end\n  parser.on \"-s\", \"--strawberry\", \"Strawberry fields forever mode ON\" do\n    strawberry = true\n  end\n  parser.missing_option do |option_flag|\n    STDERR.puts \"ERROR: #{option_flag} is missing something.\"\n    STDERR.puts \"\"\n    STDERR.puts parser\n    exit(1)\n  end\n  parser.invalid_option do |option_flag|\n    STDERR.puts \"ERROR: #{option_flag} is not a valid option.\"\n    STDERR.puts parser\n    exit(1)\n  end\nend\n\nmembers = the_beatles\nmembers = the_beatles.map &.upcase if shout\n\nputs \"Strawberry fields forever mode ON\" if strawberry\n\nputs \"\"\nputs \"Group members:\"\nputs \"==============\"\nmembers.each do |member|\n  puts \"#{strawberry ? \"🍓\" : \"-\"} #{member}\"\nend\n\nunless say_hi_to.empty?\n  puts \"\"\n  puts \"You say goodbye, and I say hello to #{say_hi_to}!\"\nend\n\nRequest for user input\nSometimes, we may need the user to input a value. How do we read that value?\nEasy, peasy! Let’s create a new application: the Fab Four will sing with us any phrase we want. When running the application, it will request a phrase to the user and the magic will happen!\n# file: let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"Welcome to The Beatles Sing Along version 1.0!\"\nputs \"Enter a phrase you want The Beatles to sing\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\nputs \"The Beatles are singing: 🎵#{user_input}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\nThe method gets will pause the execution of the application, until the user finishes entering the input (pressing the Enter key).\nWhen the user presses Enter, then the execution will continue and user_input will have the user value.\nBut what happen if the user doesn’t enter any value? In that case, we would get an empty string (if the user only presses Enter) or maybe a Nil value (if the input stream id closed, e.g. by pressing Ctrl+D).\nTo illustrate the problem let’s try the following: we want the input entered by the user to be sang loudly:\n# file: let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"Welcome to The Beatles Sing Along version 1.0!\"\nputs \"Enter a phrase you want The Beatles to sing\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\nputs \"The Beatles are singing: 🎵#{user_input.upcase}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\nWhen running the example, Crystal will reply:\n$ crystal ./let_it_cli.cr\nShowing last frame. Use --error-trace for full trace.\n\nIn let_it_cli.cr:5:46\n\n 5 | puts \"The Beatles are singing: 🎵#{user_input.upper_case}\n                                                  ^---------\nError: undefined method 'upper_case' for Nil (compile-time type is (String | Nil))\n\nAh! We should have known better: the type of the user input is the union type String | Nil.\nSo, we have to test for Nil and for empty and act naturally for each case:\n# file: let_it_cli.cr\nputs \"Welcome to The Beatles Sing Along version 1.0!\"\nputs \"Enter a phrase you want The Beatles to sing\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\n\nexit if user_input.nil? # Ctrl+D\n\ndefault_lyrics = \"Na, na, na, na-na-na na\" \\\n                 \" / \" \\\n                 \"Na-na-na na, hey Jude\"\n\nlyrics = user_input.presence || default_lyrics\n\nputs \"The Beatles are singing: 🎵#{lyrics.upcase}🎶🎸🥁\"\n\nOutput\nNow, we will focus on the second main topic: our application’s output.\nFor starters, our applications already display information but (I think) we could do better. Let’s add more life (i.e. colors!) to the outputs.\nAnd to accomplish this, we will be using the Colorize module.\nLet’s build a really simple application that shows a string with colors! We will use yellow font on a black background:\n# file: yellow_cli.cr\nrequire \"colorize\"\n\nputs \"#{\"The Beatles\".colorize(:yellow).on(:black)} App\"\n\nGreat! That was easy! Now imagine using this string as the banner for our All My CLI application, it's easy if you try:\n  parser.banner = \"#{\"The Beatles\".colorize(:yellow).on(:black)} App\"\n\nFor our second application, we will add a text decoration (blinkin this case):\n# file: let_it_cli.cr\nrequire \"colorize\"\n\nputs \"Welcome to The Beatles Sing Along version 1.0!\"\nputs \"Enter a phrase you want The Beatles to sing\"\nprint \"> \"\nuser_input = gets\n\nexit if user_input.nil? # Ctrl+D\n\ndefault_lyrics = \"Na, na, na, na-na-na na\" \\\n                 \" / \" \\\n                 \"Na-na-na na, hey Jude\"\n\nlyrics = user_input.presence || default_lyrics\n\nputs \"The Beatles are singing: #{\"🎵#{user_input}🎶🎸🥁\".colorize.mode(:blink)}\"\n\nLet’s try the renewed application … and hear the difference!!\nNow we have two fabulous apps!!\nYou may find a list of available colors and text decorations in the API documentation.\nTesting\nAs with any other application, at some point we would like to write tests for the different features.\nRight now the code containing the logic of each of the applications always gets executed with the OptionParser, i.e. there is no way to include that file without running the whole application. So first we would need to refactor the code, separating the code necessary for parsing options from the logic. Once the refactor is done, we could start testing the logic and including the file with the logic in the testing files we need. We leave this as an exercise for the reader.\nUsing Readline and NCurses\nIn case we want to build richer CLI applications, there are libraries that can help us. Here we will name two well-known libraries: Readline andNCurses.\nAs stated in the documentation for the GNU Readline Library, Readline is a library that provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.\nReadline has some great features: filename autocompletion out of the box; custom autocompletion method; keybinding, just to mention a few. If we want to try it then the crystal-lang/crystal-readline shard will give us an easy API to use Readline.\nOn the other hand, we have NCurses(New Curses). This library allows developers to create graphical user interfaces in the terminal.

It is indicated by %w and a pair of delimiters. Valid delimiters are as same as percent string literals.\n%w(foo bar baz) # => [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\n%w(foo\\nbar baz) # => [\"foo\\\\nbar\", \"baz\"]\n%w(foo(bar) baz) # => [\"foo(bar)\", \"baz\"]\n\nNote that literal denoted by %w does not apply interpolation nor escapes expect spaces. Since strings are separated by a single space character ( ) which must be escaped to use it as a part of a string.\n%w(foo\\ bar baz) # => [\"foo bar\", \"baz\"]\n\nMultiline strings\nAny string literal can span multiple lines:\n\"hello\n      world\" # => \"hello\\n      world\"\n\nNote that in the above example trailing and leading spaces, as well as newlines,\nend up in the resulting string. To avoid this a string can be split into multiple lines\nby joining multiple literals with a backslash:\n\"hello \" \\\n\"world, \" \\\n\"no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n\nAlternatively, a backslash followed by a newline can be inserted inside the string literal:\n\"hello \\\n     world, \\\n     no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n\nIn this case, leading whitespace is not included in the resulting string.\nHeredoc\nA here document or heredoc can be useful for writing strings spanning over multiple lines.\nA heredoc is denoted by  followed by an heredoc identifier which is an alphanumeric sequence starting with a letter (and may include underscores). The heredoc starts in the following line and ends with the next line that starts with the heredoc identifier (ignoring leading whitespace) and is either followed by a newline or a non-alphanumeric character.\n\n  \n\nXML\n\nLeading whitespace is removed from the heredoc contents according to the number of whitespace in the last line before the heredoc identifier.\n \"Hello\\n  world\"\n  Hello\n    world\n  STRING\n\n \"  Hello\\n    world\"\n    Hello\n      world\n  STRING\n\nIt is possible to directly call methods on heredoc string literals, or use them inside parentheses:\n \"HELLO\"\nhello\nSOME\n\ndef upcase(string)\n  string.upcase\nend\n\nupcase( \"HELLO\"\n  hello\n  SOME\n\nA heredoc generally allows interpolation and escapes.\nTo denote a heredoc without interpolation or escapes, the opening heredoc identifier is enclosed in single quotes:\n \"hello \\\\n \\#{world}\"\n  hello \\n #{world}\n  HERE\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/literals/symbol.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/literals/symbol.html","title":"符号 Symbol","keywords":"","body":"Symbol\nA Symbol represents a unique name inside the entire source code.\nSymbols are interpreted at compile time and cannot be created dynamically.

These are the only places that are looked up.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found in the require path, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found with a directory \"src\" in it and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found with a directory \"src\" in it and it contains a directory named \"filename\" directly underneath it with a \"filename.cr\" file inside it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThe second rule means that in addition to having this:\n- project\n  - src\n    - file\n      - sub1.cr\n      - sub2.cr\n    - file.cr (requires \"./file/*\")\nyou can have it like this:\n- project\n  - src\n    - file\n      - file.cr (requires \"./*\")\n      - sub1.cr\n      - sub2.cr\nwhich might be a bit cleaner depending on your taste.\nThe third rule is very convenient because of the typical directory structure of a project:\n- project\n  - lib\n    - foo\n      - src\n        - foo.cr\n    - bar\n      - src\n        - bar.cr\n  - src\n    - project.cr\n  - spec\n    - project_spec.cr\nThat is, inside \"lib/{project}\" each project's directory exists (src, spec, README.md and so on)\nFor example, if you put require \"foo\" in project.cr and run crystal src/project.cr in the project's root directory, it will find foo in lib/foo/foo.cr.\nThe fourth rule is the second rule applied to the third rule.\nIf you run the compiler from somewhere else, say the src folder, lib will not be in the path and require \"foo\" can't be resolved.\nrequire \"./filename\"\nThis looks up \"filename\" relative to the file containing the require expression.\nThe lookup goes like this:\n\nIf a file named \"filename.cr\" is found relative to the current file, it is required.\nIf a directory named \"filename\" is found and it contains a file named \"filename.cr\" directly underneath it, it is required.\nOtherwise a compile-time error is issued.\n\nThis relative is mostly used inside a project to refer to other files inside it. It is also used to refer to code from specs:\n# in spec/project_spec.cr\nrequire \"../src/project\"\n\nOther forms\nIn both cases you can use nested names and they will be looked up in nested directories:\n\nrequire \"foo/bar/baz\" will lookup \"foo/bar/baz.cr\", \"foo/bar/baz/baz.cr\", \"foo/src/bar/baz.cr\" or \"foo/src/bar/baz/baz.cr\" in the require path.\nrequire \"./foo/bar/baz\" will lookup \"foo/bar/baz.cr\" or \"foo/bar/baz/baz.cr\" relative to the current file.\n\nYou can also use \"../\" to access parent directories relative to the current file, so require \"../../foo/bar\" works as well.\nIn all of these cases you can use the special * and ** suffixes:\n\nrequire \"foo/*\" will require all \".cr\" files below the \"foo\" directory, but not below directories inside \"foo\".\nrequire \"foo/**\" will require all \".cr\" files below the \"foo\" directory, and below directories inside \"foo\", recursively.\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/types_and_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/types_and_methods.html","title":"Types and methods","keywords":"","body":"Types and methods\nThe next sections will assume you know what object oriented programming is, as well as the concepts of classes and methods.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/everything_is_an_object.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/everything_is_an_object.html","title":"Everything is an object","keywords":"","body":"Everything is an object\nIn Crystal everything is an object.

A Person has a name and an age. In the \"Everything is an object\" section we said that an object has a type and responds to some methods, which is the only way to interact with objects, so we'll need both name and age methods. We will store this information in instance variables, which are always prefixed with an at (@) character. We also want a Person to come into existence with a name of our choice and an age of zero. We code the \"come into existence\" part with a special initialize method, which is normally called a constructor:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def name\n    @name\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nNow we can create people like this:\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.name #=> \"John\"\njohn.age #=> 0\n\npeter.name #=> \"Peter\"\n\n(If you wonder why we needed to specify that name is a String but we didn't need to do it for age, check the global type inference algorithm)\nNote that we create a Person with new but we defined the initialization in an initialize method, not in a new method. Why is this so?\nThe answer is that when we defined an initialize method Crystal defined a new method for us, like this:\nclass Person\n  def self.new(name : String)\n    instance = Person.allocate\n    instance.initialize(name)\n    instance\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, note the self.new notation. This is a class method that belongs to the class Person, not to particular instances of that class. This is why we can do Person.new.\nSecond, allocate is a low-level class method that creates an uninitialized object of the given type. It basically allocates the necessary memory for the object, then initialize is invoked on it and finally the instance is returned. You generally never invoke allocate, as it is unsafe, but that's the reason why new and initialize are related.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html","title":"Methods and instance variables","keywords":"","body":"Methods and instance variables\nWe can simplify our constructor by using a shorter syntax for assigning a method argument to an instance variable:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\nend\n\nRight now, we can't do much with a person aside from create it with a name. Its age will always be zero. So lets add a method that makes a person become older:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\n\n  def age\n    @age\n  end\n\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn.age #=> 0\n\njohn.become_older\njohn.age #=> 1\n\npeter.age #=> 0\n\nMethod names begin with a lowercase letter and, as a convention, only use lowercase letters, underscores and numbers.\nGetters and setters\nThe Crystal Standard Library provides macros which simplify the definition of getter and setter methods:\nclass Person\n  property age\n  getter name : String\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\njohn.age = 32\njohn.age #=> 32\n\nFor more information on getter and setter macros, see the standard library documentation for Object#getter, Object#setter, and Object#property.\nAs a side note, we can define become_older inside the original Person definition, or in a separate definition: Crystal combines all definitions into a single class. The following works just fine:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nRedefining methods, and previous_def\nIf you redefine a method, the last definition will take precedence.\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age #=> 2\n\nYou can invoke the previously redefined method with previous_def:\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    @age += 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Person\n  def become_older\n    previous_def\n    @age += 2\n  end\nend\n\nperson = Person.new \"John\"\nperson.become_older\nperson.age #=> 3\n\nWithout arguments or parentheses, previous_def receives the same arguments as the method's arguments. Otherwise, it receives the arguments you pass to it.\nCatch-all initialization\nInstance variables can also be initialized outside initialize methods:\nclass Person\n  @age = 0\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis will initialize @age to zero in every constructor.

However, some restrictions are required.\nConsider a class definition like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWe can quickly see that @age is an integer, but we don't know the type of @name. The compiler could infer its type from all uses of the Person class. However, doing so has a few issues:\n\nThe type is not obvious for a human reading the code: they would also have to check all uses of Person to find this out.\nSome compiler optimizations, like having to analyze a method just once, and incremental compilation, are nearly impossible to do.\n\nAs a code base grows, these issues gain more relevance: understanding a project becomes harder, and compile times become unbearable.\nFor this reason, Crystal needs to know, in an obvious way (as obvious as to a human), the types of instance and class variables.\nThere are several ways to let Crystal know this.\nWith type restrictions\nThe easiest, but probably most tedious, way is to use explicit type restrictions.\nclass Person\n  @name : String\n  @age : Int32\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nWithout type restrictions\nIf you omit an explicit type restriction, the compiler will try to infer the type of instance and class variables using a bunch of syntactic rules.\nFor a given instance/class variable, when a rule can be applied and a type can be guessed, the type is added to a set. When no more rules can be applied, the inferred type will be the union of those types. Additionally, if the compiler infers that an instance variable isn't always initialized, it will also include the Nil type.\nThe rules are many, but usually the first three are most used. There's no need to remember them all. If the compiler gives an error saying that the type of an instance variable can't be inferred you can always add an explicit type restriction.\nThe following rules only mention instance variables, but they apply to class variables as well. They are:\n1. Assigning a literal value\nWhen a literal is assigned to an instance variable, the literal's type is added to the set. All literals have an associated type.\nIn the following example, @name is inferred to be String and @age to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"John Doe\"\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nThis rule, and every following rule, will also be applied in methods other than initialize. For example:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number = 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil: Int32 because 42 was assigned to it, and Nil because it wasn't assigned in all of the class' initialize methods.\n2. Assigning the result of invoking the class method new\nWhen an expression like Type.new(...) is assigned to an instance variable, the type Type is added to the set.\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.new(\"somewhere\")\n  end\nend\n\nThis also is applied to generic types. Here @values is inferred to be Array(Int32).\nclass Something\n  def initialize\n    @values = Array(Int32).new\n  end\nend\n\nNote: a new method might be redefined by a type. In that case the inferred type will be the one returned by new, if it can be inferred using some of the next rules.\n3. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a type restriction\nIn the following example @name is inferred to be String because the method argument name has a type restriction of type String, and that argument is assigned to @name.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nNote that the name of the method argument is not important; this works as well:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(obj : String)\n    @name = obj\n  end\nend\n\nUsing the shorter syntax to assign an instance variable from a method argument has the same effect:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nAlso note that the compiler doesn't check whether a method argument is reassigned a different value:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    name = 1\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above case, the compiler will still infer @name to be String, and later will give a compile time error, when fully typing that method, saying that Int32 can't be assigned to a variable of type String. Use an explicit type restriction if @name isn't supposed to be a String.\n4. Assigning the result of a class method that has a return type restriction\nIn the following example, @address is inferred to be Address, because the class method Address.unknown has a return type restriction of Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  def self.unknown : Address\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nIn fact, the above code doesn't need the return type restriction in self.unknown. The reason is that the compiler will also look at a class method's body and if it can apply one of the previous rules (it's a new method, or it's a literal, etc.) it will infer the type from that expression. So, the above can be simply written like this:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  # No need for a return type restriction here\n  def self.unknown\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nThis extra rule is very convenient because it's very common to have \"constructor-like\" class methods in addition to new.\n5. Assigning a variable that is a method argument with a default value\nIn the following example, because the default value of name is a string literal, and it's later assigned to @name, String will be added to the set of inferred types.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name = \"John Doe\")\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nThis of course also works with the short syntax:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name = \"John Doe\")\n  end\nend\n\nThe default value can also be a Type.new(...) method or a class method with a return type restriction.\n6. Assigning the result of invoking a lib function\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the return type when assigning it to an instance variable.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = LibPerson.compute_default_age\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age : Int32\nend\n\n7. Using an out lib expression\nBecause a lib function must have explicit types, the compiler can use the out argument's type, which should be a pointer type, and use the dereferenced type as a guess.\nIn the following example @age is inferred to be Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    LibPerson.compute_default_age(out @age)\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age(age_ptr : Int32*)\nend\n\nOther rules\nThe compiler will try to be as smart as possible to require less explicit type restrictions. For example, if assigning an if expression, type will be inferred from the then and else branches:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = some_condition ? 1 : 2\n  end\nend\n\nBecause the if above (well, technically a ternary operator, but it's similar to an if) has integer literals, @age is successfully inferred to be Int32 without requiring a redundant type restriction.\nAnother case is || and ||=:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number ||= 42\n  end\nend\n\nIn the above example @lucky_number will be inferred to be Int32 | Nil. This is very useful for lazily initialized variables.\nConstants will also be followed, as it's pretty simple for the compiler (and a human) to do so.\nclass SomeObject\n  DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER = 42\n\n  def initialize(@lucky_number = DEFAULT_LUCKY_NUMBER)\n  end\nend\n\nHere rule 5 (argument's default value) is used, and because the constant resolves to an integer literal, @lucky_number is inferred to be Int32.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html","title":"Union types","keywords":"","body":"Union types\nThe type of a variable or expression can consist of multiple types.

This union type is created automatically by the compiler. At runtime, a will of course be of one type only.

For example:\njohn.become_older by: 5\n\nWhen there are many arguments, the order of the names in the invocation doesn't matter, as long as all required arguments are covered:\ndef some_method(x, y = 1, z = 2, w = 3)\n  # do something...\nend\n\nsome_method 10                   # x: 10, y: 1, z: 2, w: 3\nsome_method 10, z: 10            # x: 10, y: 1, z: 10, w: 3\nsome_method 10, w: 1, y: 2, z: 3 # x: 10, y: 2, z: 3, w: 1\nsome_method y: 10, x: 20         # x: 20, y: 10, z: 2, w: 3\n\nsome_method y: 10                # Error, missing argument: x\n\nWhen a method specifies a splat (explained in the next section), named arguments can't be used.

So, in general, it's preferable not to specify type restrictions and almost only use them to define different method overloads. This results in more generic, reusable code. For example, if we define a class that has a + method but isn't a Number, we can use the add method that doesn't have type restrictions, but we can't use the add method that has restrictions.\n# A class that has a + method but isn't a Number\nclass Six\n  def +(other)\n    6 + other\n  end\nend\n\n# add method without type restrictions\ndef add(x, y)\n  x + y\nend\n\n# OK\nadd Six.new, 10\n\n# add method with type restrictions\ndef restricted_add(x : Number, y : Number)\n  x + y\nend\n\n# Error: no overload matches 'restricted_add' with types Six, Int32\nrestricted_add Six.new, 10\n\nRefer to the type grammar for the notation used in type restrictions.\nNote that type restrictions do not apply to the variables inside the actual methods.\ndef handle_path(path : String)\n  path = Path.new(path) # *path* is now of the type Path\n  # Do something with *path*\nend\n\nself restriction\nA special type restriction is self:\nclass Person\n  def ==(other : self)\n    other.name == name\n  end\n\n  def ==(other)\n    false\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\nanother_john = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\njohn == another_john #=> true\njohn == peter #=> false (names differ)\njohn == 1 #=> false (because 1 is not a Person)\n\nIn the previous example self is the same as writing Person. But, in general, self is the same as writing the type that will finally own that method, which, when modules are involved, becomes more useful.\nAs a side note, since Person inherits Reference the second definition of == is not needed, since it's already defined in Reference.\nNote that self always represents a match against an instance type, even in class methods:\nclass Person\n  getter name : String\n\n  def initialize(@name)\n  end\n\n  def self.compare(p1 : self, p2 : self)\n    p1.name == p2.name\n  end\nend\n\njohn = Person.new \"John\"\npeter = Person.new \"Peter\"\n\nPerson.compare(john, peter) # OK\n\nYou can use self.class to restrict to the Person type.

Additionally, the empty-tuple doesn't match any of the above cases. If you want to support the empty-tuple case, add another overload:\ndef foo\n  # This is the empty-tuple case\nend\n\nA simple way to match against one or more elements of any type is to use Object as a restriction:\ndef foo(*args : Object)\nend\n\nfoo() # Error\nfoo(1) # OK\nfoo(1, \"x\") # OK\n\nFree variables\nYou can make a type restriction take the type of an argument, or part of the type of an argument, using forall:\ndef foo(x : T) forall T\n  T\nend\n\nfoo(1)       #=> Int32\nfoo(\"hello\") #=> String\n\nThat is, T becomes the type that was effectively used to instantiate the method.\nA free variable can be used to extract the type parameter of a generic type within a type restriction:\ndef foo(x : Array(T)) forall T\n  T\nend\n\nfoo([1, 2])   #=> Int32\nfoo([1, \"a\"]) #=> (Int32 | String)\n\nTo create a method that accepts a type name, rather than an instance of a type, append .class to a free variable in the type restriction:\ndef foo(x : T.class) forall T\n  Array(T)\nend\n\nfoo(Int32)  #=> Array(Int32)\nfoo(String) #=> Array(String)\n\nMultiple free variables can be specified too, for matching types of multiple arguments:\ndef push(element : T, array : Array(T)) forall T\n  array \n"},"syntax_and_semantics/return_types.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/return_types.html","title":"Return types","keywords":"","body":"Return types\nA method's return type is always inferred by the compiler.

This is expressed as the special return type NoReturn.\nTypical examples for non-returning methods and keywords are return, exit, raise, next, and break.\nThis is for example useful for deconstructing union types:\nstring = STDIN.gets\ntypeof(string)                        # => String?\ntypeof(raise \"Empty input\")           # => NoReturn\ntypeof(string || raise \"Empty input\") # => String\nThe compiler recognizes that in case string is Nil, the right hand side of the expression string || raise will be evaluated. Since typeof(raise \"Empty input\") is NoReturn the execution would not return to the current scope in that case. That leaves only String as resulting type of the expression.\nEvery expression whose code paths all result in NoReturn will be NoReturn as well. NoReturn does not show up in a union type because it would essentially be included in every expression's type. It is only used when an expression will never return to the current scope.\nNoReturn can be explicitly set as return type of a method or function definition but will usually be inferred by the compiler.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/default_values_named_arguments_splats_tuples_and_overloading.html","title":"Method arguments","keywords":"","body":"Method arguments\nThis is the formal specification of method and call arguments.\nComponents of a method definition\nA method definition consists of:\n\nrequired and optional positional arguments\nan optional splat argument, whose name can be empty\nrequired and optional named arguments\nan optional double splat argument\n\nFor example:\ndef foo(\n  # These are positional arguments:\n  x, y, z = 1,\n  # This is the splat argument:\n  *args,\n  # These are the named arguments:\n  a, b, c = 2,\n  # This is the double splat argument:\n  **options\n  )\nend\n\nEach one of them is optional, so a method can do without the double splat, without the splat, without keyword arguments and without positional arguments.\nComponents of a method call\nA method call also has some parts:\nfoo(\n  # These are positional arguments\n  1, 2,\n  # These are named arguments\n  a: 1, b: 2\n)\n\nAdditionally, a call argument can have a splat (*) or double splat (**). A splat expands a Tuple into positional arguments, while a double splat expands a NamedTuple into named arguments. Multiple argument splats and double splats are allowed.\nHow call arguments are matched to method arguments\nWhen invoking a method, the algorithm to match call arguments to method arguments is:\n\nFirst positional arguments are matched with positional method arguments. The number of these must be at least the number of positional arguments without a default value. If there's a splat method argument with a name (the case without a name is explained below), more positional arguments are allowed and they are captured as a tuple. Positional arguments never match past the splat method argument.\nThen named arguments are matched, by name, with any argument in the method (it can be before or after the splat method argument). If an argument was already filled by a positional argument then it's an error.\nExtra named arguments are placed in the double splat method argument, as a NamedTuple, if it exists, otherwise it's an error.\n\nWhen a splat method argument has no name, it means no more positional arguments can be passed, and next arguments must be passed as named arguments. For example:\n# Only one positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 1)\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\n\nBut even if a splat method argument has a name, arguments that follow it must be passed as named arguments:\n# One or more positional argument allowed, y must be passed as a named argument\ndef foo(x, *args, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1 # Error, missing argument: y\nfoo 1, 2 # Error: missing argument; y\nfoo 1, 2, 3 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo 1, y: 10 # OK\nfoo 1, 2, 3, y: 4 # OK\n\nThere's also the possibility of making a method only receive named arguments (and list them), by placing the star at the beginning:\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing arguments: x, y\nfoo x: 1 # Error: missing argument: y\nfoo x: 1, y: 2 # OK\n\nArguments past the star can also have default values. It means: they must be passed as named arguments, but they aren't required (so: optional named arguments):\n# A method with two required named arguments: x and y\ndef foo(*, x, y = 2)\nend\n\nfoo # Error: missing argument: x\nfoo x: 1 # OK, y is 2\nfoo x: 1, y: 3 # OK, y is 3\n\nBecause arguments (without a default value) after the splat method argument must be passed by name, two methods with different required named arguments overload:\ndef foo(*, x)\n  puts \"Passed with x: #{x}\"\nend\n\ndef foo(*, y)\n  puts \"Passed with y: #{y}\"\nend\n\nfoo x: 1 # => Passed with x: 1\nfoo y: 2 # => Passed with y: 2\n\nPositional arguments can always be matched by name:\ndef foo(x, *, y)\nend\n\nfoo 1, y: 2 # OK\nfoo y: 2, x: 3 # OK\n\nExternal names\nAn external name can be specified for a method argument. The external name is the one used when passing an argument as a named argument, and the internal name is the one used inside the method definition:\ndef foo(external_name internal_name)\n  # here we use internal_name\nend\n\nfoo external_name: 1\n\nThis covers two uses cases.\nThe first use case is using keywords as named arguments:\ndef plan(begin begin_time, end end_time)\n  puts \"Planning between #{begin_time} and #{end_time}\"\nend\n\nplan begin: Time.now, end: 2.days.from_now\n\nThe second use case is making a method argument more readable inside a method body:\ndef increment(value, by)\n  # OK, but reads odd\n  value + by\nend\n\ndef increment(value, by amount)\n  # Better\n  value + amount\nend\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nCrystal supports a number of operators, with one, two or three operands.\nOperator expressions are actually parsed as method calls. For example a + b\nis semantically equivalent to a.+(b), a call to method + on a with\nargument b.\nThere are however some special rules regarding operator syntax:\n\nThe dot (.) usually put between receiver and method name\n(i.e. the operator) can be omitted.\nChained sequences of operator calls are restructured by the compiler in order\nto implement operator precedence.\nEnforcing operator precedence makes sure that an expression such as\n1 * 2 + 3 * 4 is parsed as (1 * 2) + (2 * 3) to honour regular math rules.\nRegular method names must start with a letter or underscore, but operators\nonly consist of special characters. Any method not starting with a letter or\nunderscore is an operator  method.\nAvailable operators are whitelisted in the compiler (see\nList of Operators below) which allows symbol-only method\nnames and treats them as operators, including their precedence rules.\n\nOperators are implemented like any regular method, and the standard library\noffers many implementations, for example for math expressions.\nDefining operator methods\nMost operators can be implemented as regular methods.\nOne can assign any meaning to the operators, but it is advisable to stay within\nsimilar semantics to the generic operator meaning to avoid cryptic code that is\nconfusing and behaves unexpectedly.\nA few operators are defined directly by the compiler and cannot be redefined\nin user code. Examples for this are the inversion operator !, the assignment\noperator =, combined assignment operators such as\n||= and range operators. Whether a method can be redefined is\nindicated by the colum Overloadable in the below operator tables.\nUnary operators\nUnary operators are written in prefix notation and have only a single operand.\nThus, a method implementation receives no arguments and only operates on self.\nThe following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional\nvector with a unary operator method - for vector inversion.\nstruct Vector2\n  getter x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\n\n  # Unary operator. Returns the inverted vector to `self`.\n  def - : self\n    Vector2.new(-x, -y)\n  end\nend\n\nv1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)\n-v1 #=> Vector2(@x=-1, @y=-2)\n\nBinary operators\nBinary operators have two operands. Thus, a method implementation receives\nexactly one argument representing the second operand. The first operand is the\nreceiver self.\nThe following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional\nvector with a binary operator method + for vector addition.\nstruct Vector2\n  getter x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\n\n  # Binary operator. Returns *other* added to `self`.\n  def +(other : self) : self\n    Vector2.new(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n  end\nend\n\nv1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)\nv2 = Vector2.new(3, 4)\nv1 + v2 #=> Vector2(@x=4, @y=6)\n\nPer convention, the return type of a binary operator should be the type of the\nfirst operand (the receiver), so that typeof(a  b) == typeof(a).\nOtherwise the assignment operator (a = b) would unintentionally change the\ntype of a.\nThere can be reasonable exceptions though. For example in the standard library\nthe float division operator / on integer types always returns Float64,\nbecause the quotient must not be limited to the value range of integers.\nTernary operators\nThe conditional operator (? :) is the only ternary\noperator.

But, on the other hand, it makes sense: classes under the same hierarchy should behave in a similar way.\nLets make John's pet talk:\njohn.pet.talk # Error: undefined method 'talk' for Animal\n\nWe get an error because the compiler now treats @pet as an Animal+, which includes Animal. And since it can't find a talk method on it, it errors.\nWhat the compiler doesn't know is that for us, Animal will never be instantiated as it doesn't make sense to instantiate one. We have a way to tell the compiler so by marking the class as abstract:\nabstract class Animal\nend\n\nNow the code compiles:\njohn.pet.talk #=> \"Woof!\"\n\nMarking a class as abstract will also prevent us from creating an instance of it:\nAnimal.new # Error: can't instantiate abstract class Animal\n\nTo make it more explicit that an Animal must define a talk method, we can add it to Animal as an abstract method:\nabstract class Animal\n  # Makes this animal talk\n  abstract def talk\nend\n\nBy marking a method as abstract the compiler will check that all subclasses implement this method, even if a program doesn't use them.\nAbstract methods can also be defined in modules, and the compiler will check that including types implement them.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_methods.html","title":"Class methods","keywords":"","body":"Class methods\nClass methods are methods associated to a class or module instead of a specific instance.\nmodule CaesarCipher\n  def self.encrypt(string : String)\n    string.chars.map{ |char| ((char.upcase.ord - 52) % 26 + 65).chr }.join\n  end\nend\n\nCaesarCipher.encrypt(\"HELLO\") # => \"URYYB\"\n\nClass methods are defined by prefixing the method name with the type name and a period.\ndef CaesarCipher.decrypt(string : String)\n  encrypt(string)\nend\n\nWhen they're defined inside a class or module scope it is easier to use self instead of the class name.\nClass methods can also be defined by extending a Module.\nA class method can be called under the same name as it was defined (CaesarCipher.decrypt(\"HELLO\")).\nWhen called from within the same class or module scope the receiver can be self or implicit (like encrypt(string)).\nConstructors\nConstructors are normal class methods which create a new instance of the class.\nBy default all classes in Crystal have at least one constructor called new, but they may also define other constructors with different names.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/class_variables.html","title":"Class variables","keywords":"","body":"Class variables\nClass variables are associated to classes instead of instances.

When inheriting you can specify an instance of the generic type, or delegate type variables:\nclass Parent(T)\nend\n\nclass Int32Child \n"},"syntax_and_semantics/structs.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/structs.html","title":"Structs","keywords":"","body":"Structs\nInstead of defining a type with class you can do so with struct:\nstruct Point\n  property x, y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nStructs inherit from Value so they are allocated on the stack and passed by value: when passed to methods, returned from methods or assigned to variables, a copy of the value is actually passed (while classes inherit from Reference, are allocated on the heap and passed by reference).\nTherefore structs are mostly useful for immutable data types and/or stateless wrappers of other types, usually for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient (for more details, see the performance guide).\nMutable structs are still allowed, but you should be careful when writing code involving mutability if you want to avoid surprises that are described below.\nPassing by value\nA struct is always passed by value, even when you return self from the method of that struct:\nstruct Counter\n  def initialize(@count : Int32)\n  end\n\n  def plus\n    @count += 1\n    self\n  end\nend\n\ncounter = Counter.new(0)\ncounter.plus.plus #=> Counter(@x=2)\nputs counter      #=> Counter(@x=1)\n\nNotice that the chained calls of plus return the expected result, but only the first call to it modifies the variable counter, as the second call operates on the copy of the struct passed to it from the first call, and this copy is discarded after the expression is executed.\nYou should also be careful when working on mutable types inside of the struct:\nclass Klass\n  property array = [\"str\"]\nend\n\nstruct Strukt\n  property array = [\"str\"]\nend\n\ndef modify(object)\n  object.array  [\"new\", \"bar\"]\nputs klass.array    #=> [\"new\", \"bar\"]\n\nstrukt = Strukt.new\nputs modify(strukt) #=> [\"new\", \"bar\"]\nputs strukt.array   #=> [\"str\", \"foo\"]\n\nWhat happens with the strukt here:\n\nArray is passed by reference, so the reference to [\"str\"] is stored in the property of strukt\nwhen strukt is passed to modify, a copy of the strukt is passed with the reference to array inside it\nthe array referenced by array is modified (element inside it is added) by object.array \nthis is also reflected in the original strukt as it holds reference to the same array\nobject.array = [\"new\"] replaces the reference in the copy of strukt with the reference to the new array\nobject.array  appends to this newly created array\nmodify returns the reference to this new array and its content is printed\nthe reference to this new array was held only in the copy of strukt, but not in the original, so that's why the original strukt only retained the result of the first statement, but not of the other two statements\n\nKlass is a class, so it is passed by reference to modify, and object.array = [\"new\"] saves the reference to the newly created array in the original klass object, not in the copy as it was with the strukt.\nInheritance\n\nA struct implicitly inherits from Struct, which inherits from Value. A class implicitly inherits from Reference.\nA struct cannot inherit from a non-abstract struct.\n\nThe second point has a reason to it: a struct has a very well defined memory layout. For example, the above Point struct occupies 8 bytes. If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer:\n# The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point\nary = [] of Point\n\nIf Point is inherited, an array of such type should also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element should grow to accommodate that. That is certainly unexpected. So, non-abstract structs can't be inherited from. Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it is expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it.\nA struct can also include modules and can be generic, just like a class.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/constants.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/constants.html","title":"Constants","keywords":"","body":"Constants\nConstants can be declared at the top level or inside other types.

This changes the default values:\n@[Flags]\nenum IOMode\n  Read # 1\n  Write  # 2\n  Async # 4\nend\n\nThe @[Flags] attribute makes the first constant's value be 1, and successive constants are multiplied by 2.\nImplicit constants, None and All, are automatically added to these enums, where None has the value 0 and All has the \"or\"ed value of all constants.\nIOMode::None.value #=> 0\nIOMode::All.value  #=> 7\n\nAdditionally, some Enum methods check the @[Flags] attribute. For example:\nputs(Color::Red)                    # prints \"Red\"\nputs(IOMode::Write | IOMode::Async) # prints \"Write, Async\"\n\nEnums from integers\nAn enum can be created from an integer:\nputs Color.new(1) #=> prints \"Green\"\n\nValues that don't correspond to an enum's constants are allowed: the value will still be of type Color, but when printed you will get the underlying value:\nputs Color.new(10) #=> prints \"10\"\n\nThis method is mainly intended to convert integers from C to enums in Crystal.\nMethods\nJust like a class or a struct, you can define methods for enums:\nenum Color\n  Red\n  Green\n  Blue\n\n  def red?\n    self == Color::Red\n  end\nend\n\nColor::Red.red?  #=> true\nColor::Blue.red? #=> false\n\nClass variables are allowed, but instance variables are not.\nUsage\nEnums are a type-safe alternative to Symbol.

For example:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\nThe above program prints \"Hello!\" twice, once for each yield.\nTo define a method that receives a block, simply use yield inside it and the compiler will know. You can make this more evident by declaring a dummy block argument, indicated as a last argument prefixed with ampersand (&):\ndef twice(&block)\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\nTo invoke a method and pass a block, you use do ... end or { ... }. All of these are equivalent:\ntwice() do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice do\n  puts \"Hello!\"\nend\n\ntwice { puts \"Hello!\" }\n\nThe difference between using do ... end and { ... } is that do ... end binds to the left-most call, while { ... } binds to the right-most call:\nfoo bar do\n  something\nend\n\n# The above is the same as\nfoo(bar) do\n  something\nend\n\nfoo bar { something }\n\n# The above is the same as\n\nfoo(bar { something })\n\nThe reason for this is to allow creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using do ... end to have them be read as plain English:\nopen file \"foo.cr\" do\n  something\nend\n\n# Same as:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\")) do\nend\n\nYou wouldn't want the above to be:\nopen(file(\"foo.cr\") do\nend)\n\nOverloads\nTwo methods, one that yields and another that doesn't, are considered different overloads, as explained in the overloading section.\nYield arguments\nThe yield expression is similar to a call and can receive arguments. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Got 1\" and \"Got 2\".\nA curly braces notation is also available:\ntwice { |i| puts \"Got #{i}\" }\n\nYou can yield many values:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y, z|\n  puts x + y + z\nend\n\n# Output: 6\n\nA block can specify less than the arguments yielded:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y|\n  puts x + y\nend\n\n# Output: 3\n\nIt's an error specifying more block arguments than those yielded:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do |i| # Error: too many block arguments\nend\n\nEach block variable has the type of every yield expression in that position. For example:\ndef some\n  yield 1, 'a'\n  yield true, \"hello\"\n  yield 2, nil\nend\n\nsome do |first, second|\n  # first is Int32 | Bool\n  # second is Char | String | Nil\nend\n\nThe block variable second also includes the Nil type because the last yield expression didn't include a second argument.\nShort one-argument syntax\nIf a block has a single argument and invokes a method on it, the block can be replaced with the short syntax argument.\nThis:\nmethod do |argument|\n  argument.some_method\nend\n\nand\nmethod { |argument| argument.some_method }\n\ncan both be written as:\nmethod &.some_method\n\nOr like:\nmethod(&.some_method)\n\nIn either case, &.some_method is an argument passed to method.  This argument is syntactically equivalent to the block variants.  It is only syntactic sugar and does not have any performance penalty.\nIf the method has other required parameters, the short syntax argument should also be supplied in the method's argument list.\n[\"a\", \"b\"].join(\",\", &.upcase)\n\nIs equivalent to:\n[\"a\", \"b\"].join(\",\") { |s| s.upcase }\n\nArguments can be used with the short syntax argument as well:\n[\"i\", \"o\"].join(\",\", &.upcase(Unicode::CaseOptions::Turkic))\n\nOperators can be invoked too:\nmethod &.+(2)\nmethod(&.[index])\n\nyield value\nThe yield expression itself has a value: the last expression of the block. For example:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  i + 1\nend\n\nThe above prints \"2\" and \"3\".\nA yield expression's value is mostly useful for transforming and filtering values. The best examples of this are Enumerable#map and Enumerable#select:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\nary.map { |x| x + 1 }         #=> [2, 3, 4]\nary.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 } #=> [1, 3]\n\nA dummy transformation method:\ndef transform(value)\n  yield value\nend\n\ntransform(1) { |x| x + 1 } #=> 2\n\nThe result of the last expression is 2 because the last expression of the transform method is yield, whose value is the last expression of the block.\nType restrictions\nThe type of the block in a method that uses yield can be restricted using the &block syntax. For example:\ndef transform_int(start : Int32, &block : Int32 -> Int32)\n  result = yield start\n  result * 2\nend\n\ntransform_int(3) { |x| x + 2 } #=> 10\ntransform_int(3) { |x| \"foo\" } # Error: expected block to return Int32, not String\n\nbreak\nA break expression inside a block exits early from the method:\ndef thrice\n  puts \"Before 1\"\n  yield 1\n  puts \"Before 2\"\n  yield 2\n  puts \"Before 3\"\n  yield 3\n  puts \"After 3\"\nend\n\nthrice do |i|\n  if i == 2\n    break\n  end\nend\n\nThe above prints \"Before 1\" and \"Before 2\". The thrice method didn't execute the puts \"Before 3\" expression because of the break.\nbreak can also accept arguments: these become the method's return value. For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice { |i| i + 1 } #=> 3\ntwice { |i| break \"hello\" } #=> \"hello\"\n\nThe first call's value is 3 because the last expression of the twice method is yield, which gets the value of the block. The second call's value is \"hello\" because a break was performed.\nIf there are conditional breaks, the call's return value type will be a union of the type of the block's value and the type of the many breaks:\nvalue = twice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    break \"hello\"\n  end\n  i + 1\nend\nvalue #:: Int32 | String\n\nIf a break receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple:\nvalues = twice { break 1, 2 }\nvalues #=> {1, 2}\n\nIf a break receives no arguments, it's the same as receiving a single nil argument:\nvalue = twice { break }\nvalue #=> nil\n\nnext\nThe next expression inside a block exits early from the block (not the method). For example:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    puts \"Skipping 1\"\n    next\n  end\n\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\n# Ouptut:\n# Skipping 1\n# Got 2\n\nThe next expression accepts arguments, and these give the value of the yield expression that invoked the block:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  if i == 1\n    next 10\n  end\n\n  i + 1\nend\n\n# Output\n# 10\n# 3\n\nIf a next receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple. If it receives no arguments it's the same as receiving a single nil argument.\nwith ... yield\nA yield expression can be modified, using the with keyword, to specify an object to use as the default receiver of method calls within the block:\nclass Foo\n  def one\n    1\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\n\n  def yield_normally\n    yield\n  end\nend\n\ndef one\n  \"one\"\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { one } # => 1\nFoo.new.yield_normally { one }  # => \"one\"\n\nUnpacking block arguments\nA block argument can specify sub-arguments enclosed in parentheses:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |(number, word)|\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThe above is simply syntax sugar of this:\narray = [{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"two\"}]\narray.each do |arg|\n  number = arg[0]\n  word = arg[1]\n  puts \"#{number}: #{word}\"\nend\n\nThat means that any type that responds to [] with integers can be unpacked in a block argument.\nPerformance\nWhen using blocks with yield, the blocks are always inlined: no closures, calls or function pointers are involved. This means that this:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got: #{i}\"\nend\n\nis exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 1\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\ni = 2\nputs \"Got: #{i}\"\n\nFor example, the standard library includes a times method on integers, allowing you to write:\n3.times do |i|\n  puts i\nend\n\nThis looks very fancy, but is it as fast as a C for loop? The answer is: yes!\nThis is Int#times definition:\nstruct Int\n  def times\n    i = 0\n    while i \nBecause a non-captured block is always inlined, the above method invocation is exactly the same as writing this:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nHave no fear using blocks for readability or code reuse, it won't affect the resulting executable performance.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/capturing_blocks.html","title":"Capturing blocks","keywords":"","body":"Capturing blocks\nA block can be captured and turned into a Proc, which represents a block of code with an associated context: the closured data.\nTo capture a block you must specify it as a method's block argument, give it a name and specify the input and output types.

Unlike other keywords, raise is a regular method with two overloads: one accepting a String and another accepting an Exception instance:\nraise \"OH NO!\"\nraise Exception.new(\"Some error\")\n\nThe String version just creates a new Exception instance with that message.\nOnly Exception instances or subclasses can be raised.\nDefining custom exceptions\nTo define a custom exception type, just subclass from Exception:\nclass MyException \nYou can, as always, define a constructor for your exception or just use the default one.\nRescuing exceptions\nTo rescue any exception use a begin ... rescue ... end expression:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue\n  puts \"Rescued!\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued!\n\nTo access the rescued exception you can specify a variable in the rescue clause:\nbegin\n  raise \"OH NO!\"\nrescue ex\n  puts ex.message\nend\n\n# Output: OH NO!\n\nTo rescue just one type of exception (or any of its subclasses):\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException\n\nAnd to access it, use a syntax similar to type restrictions:\nbegin\n  raise MyException.new(\"OH NO!\")\nrescue ex : MyException\n  puts \"Rescued MyException: #{ex.message}\"\nend\n\n# Output: Rescued MyException: OH NO!\n\nMultiple rescue clauses can be specified:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex1 : MyException\n  # only MyException...\nrescue ex2 : MyOtherException\n  # only MyOtherException...\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nYou can also rescue multiple exception types at once by specifying a union type:\nbegin\n  # ...\nrescue ex : MyException | MyOtherException\n  # only MyException or MyOtherException\nrescue\n  # any other kind of exception\nend\n\nelse\nAn else clause is executed only if no exceptions were rescued:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute this if an exception is raised\nelse\n  # execute this if an exception isn't raised\nend\n\nAn else clause can only be specified if at least one rescue clause is specified.\nensure\nAn ensure clause is executed at the end of a begin ... end or begin ... rescue ... end expression regardless of whether an exception was raised or not:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts \"Cleanup...\"\nend\n\n# Will print \"Cleanup...\" after invoking something_dangerous,\n# regardless of whether it raised or not\n\nOr:\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # ...\nelse\n  # ...\nensure\n  # this will always be executed\nend\n\nensure clauses are usually used for clean up, freeing resources, etc.\nShort syntax form\nException handling has a short syntax form: assume a method or block definition is an implicit begin ... end expression, then specify rescue, else, and ensure clauses:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nrescue\n  # execute if an exception is raised\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  rescue\n    # execute if an exception is raised\n  end\nend\n\nWith ensure:\ndef some_method\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  # always execute this\nend\n\n# The above is the same as:\ndef some_method\n  begin\n    something_dangerous\n  ensure\n    # always execute this\n  end\nend\n\n# Similarly, the shorthand also works with blocks:\n(1..10).each do |n|\n  # potentially dangerous operation\nrescue\n  #..\nelse\n  #..\nensure\n  #..\nend\n\nType inference\nVariables declared inside the begin part of an exception handler also get the Nil type when considered inside a rescue or ensure body. For example:\nbegin\n  a = something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nThe above happens even if something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32 never raises, or if a was assigned a value and then a method that potentially raises is executed:\nbegin\n  a = 1\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # error, undefined method '+' for Nil\nend\n\nAlthough it is obvious that a will always be assigned a value, the compiler will still think a might never had a chance to be initialized. Even though this logic might improve in the future, right now it forces you to keep your exception handlers to their necessary minimum, making the code's intention more clear:\n# Clearer than the above: `a` doesn't need\n# to be in the exception handling code.\na = 1\nbegin\n  something_dangerous\nensure\n  puts a + 1 # works\nend\n\nAlternative ways to do error handling\nAlthough exceptions are available as one of the mechanisms for handling errors, they are not your only choice. Raising an exception involves allocating memory, and executing an exception handler is generally slow.\nThe standard library usually provides a couple of methods to accomplish something: one raises, one returns nil. For example:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\narray[4]  # raises because of IndexError\narray[4]? # returns nil because of index out of bounds\n\nThe usual convention is to provide an alternative \"question\" method to signal that this variant of the method returns nil instead of raising. This lets the user choose whether she wants to deal with exceptions or with nil. Note, however, that this is not available for every method out there, as exceptions are still the preferred way because they don't pollute the code with error handling logic.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/type_grammar.html","title":"Type grammar","keywords":"","body":"Type grammar\nWhen:\n\nspecifying type restrictions\nspecifying type arguments\ndeclaring variables\ndeclaring aliases\ndeclaring typedefs\nthe argument of an is_a? pseudo-call\nthe argument of an as expression\nthe argument of a sizeof expression\nthe argument of an instance_sizeof expression\na method's return type\n\na convenient syntax is provided for some common types.

If for some reason we are sure a is an Int32 after the if, we can force the compiler to treat it like one:\na_as_int = a.as(Int32)\na_as_int.abs          # works, compiler knows that a_as_int is Int32\n\nThe as pseudo-method performs a runtime check: if a wasn't an Int32, an exception is raised.\nThe argument to the expression is a type.\nIf it is impossible for a type to be restricted by another type, a compile-time error is issued:\n1.as(String) # Compile-time error\n\nNote:  you can't use as to convert a type to an unrelated type: as is not like a cast in other languages. Methods on integers, floats and chars are provided for these conversions. Alternatively, use pointer casts as explained below.\nConverting between pointer types\nThe as pseudo-method also allows to cast between pointer types:\nptr = Pointer(Int32).malloc(1)\nptr.as(Int8*)                    #:: Pointer(Int8)\n\nIn this case, no runtime checks are done: pointers are unsafe and this type of casting is usually only needed in C bindings and low-level code.\nConverting between pointer types and other types\nConversion between pointer types and Reference types is also possible:\narray = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# object_id returns the address of an object in memory,\n# so we create a pointer with that address\nptr = Pointer(Void).new(array.object_id)\n\n# Now we cast that pointer to the same type, and\n# we should get the same value\narray2 = ptr.as(Array(Int32))\narray2.same?(array) #=> true\n\nNo runtime checks are performed in these cases because, again, pointers are involved. The need for this cast is even more rare than the previous one, but allows to implement some core types (like String) in Crystal itself, and it also allows passing a Reference type to C functions by casting it to a void pointer.\nUsage for casting to a bigger type\nThe as pseudo-method can be used to cast an expression to a \"bigger\" type. For example:\na = 1\nb = a.as(Int32 | Float64)\nb #:: Int32 | Float64\n\nThe above might not seem to be useful, but it is when, for example, mapping an array of elements:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# We want to create an array 1, 2, 3 of Int32 | Float64\nary2 = ary.map { |x| x.as(Int32 | Float64) }\n\nary2 #:: Array(Int32 | Float64)\nary2 \nThe Array#map method uses the block's type as the generic type for the Array. Without the as pseudo-method, the inferred type would have been Int32 and we wouldn't have been able to add a Float64 into it.\nUsage for when the compiler can't infer the type of a block\nSometimes the compiler can't infer the type of a block.

Refer to Pitfalls for more information.\nScope\nMacros declared at the top-level are visible anywhere. If a top-level macro is marked as private it is only accessible in that file.\nThey can also be defined in classes and modules, and are visible in those scopes. Macros are also looked-up in the ancestors chain (superclasses and included modules).\nFor example, a block which is given an object to use as the default receiver by being invoked with with ... yield can access macros defined within that object's ancestors chain:\nclass Foo\n  macro emphasize(value)\n    \"***#{ {{value}} }***\"\n  end\n\n  def yield_with_self\n    with self yield\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.new.yield_with_self { emphasize(10) } # => \"***10***\"\n\nMacros defined in classes and modules can be invoked from outside of them too:\nclass Foo\n  macro emphasize(value)\n    \"***#{ {{value}} }***\"\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.emphasize(10) # => \"***10***\"\n\nInterpolation\nYou use {{...}} to paste, or interpolate, an AST node, as in the above example.\nNote that the node is pasted as-is.

You can use the method ASTNode#id in these cases, where you just need an identifier.\nMacro calls\nYou can invoke a fixed subset of methods on AST nodes at compile-time. These methods are documented in a fictitious Crystal::Macros module.\nFor example, invoking ASTNode#id in the above example solves the problem:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{content}}\n  end\nend\n\n# This correctly generates:\n#\n#     def foo\n#       1\n#     end\ndefine_method :foo, 1\n\nModules and classes\nModules, classes and structs can also be generated:\nmacro define_class(module_name, class_name, method, content)\n  module {{module_name}}\n    class {{class_name}}\n      def initialize(@name : String)\n      end\n\n      def {{method}}\n        {{content}} + @name\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#     module Foo\n#       class Bar\n#         def initialize(@name : String)\n#         end\n#\n#         def say\n#           \"hi \" + @name\n#         end\n#       end\n#     end\ndefine_class Foo, Bar, say, \"hi \"\n\np Foo::Bar.new(\"John\").say # => \"hi John\"\n\nConditionals\nYou use {% if condition %} ... {% end %} to conditionally generate code:\nmacro define_method(name, content)\n  def {{name}}\n    {% if content == 1 %}\n      \"one\"\n    {% elsif content == 2 %}\n      \"two\"\n    {% else %}\n      {{content}}\n    {% end %}\n  end\nend\n\ndefine_method foo, 1\ndefine_method bar, 2\ndefine_method baz, 3\n\nfoo # => one\nbar # => two\nbaz # => 3\n\nSimilar to regular code, Nop, NilLiteral and a false BoolLiteral are considered falsey, while everything else is considered truthy.\nMacro conditionals can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% if env(\"TEST\") %}\n  puts \"We are in test mode\"\n{% end %}\n\nIteration\nYou can iterate a finite amount of times:\nmacro define_constants(count)\n  {% for i in (1..count) %}\n    PI_{{i.id}} = Math::PI * {{i}}\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_constants(3)\n\nPI_1 # => 3.14159...\nPI_2 # => 6.28318...\nPI_3 # => 9.42477...\n\nTo iterate an ArrayLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods [foo, bar, baz]\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nThe index variable in the above example is optional.\nTo iterate a HashLiteral:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(hash)\n  {% for key, value in hash %}\n    def {{key.id}}\n      {{value}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\ndefine_dummy_methods({foo: 10, bar: 20})\nfoo # => 10\nbar # => 20\n\nMacro iterations can be used outside a macro definition:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nVariadic arguments and splatting\nA macro can accept variadic arguments:\nmacro define_dummy_methods(*names)\n  {% for name, index in names %}\n    def {{name.id}}\n      {{index}}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\ndefine_dummy_methods foo, bar, baz\n\nfoo # => 0\nbar # => 1\nbaz # => 2\n\nThe arguments are packed into an ArrayLiteral and passed to the macro.\nAdditionally, using * when interpolating an ArrayLiteral interpolates the elements separated by commas:\nmacro println(*values)\n  print {{*values}}, '\\n'\nend\n\nprintln 1, 2, 3 # outputs 123\\n\n\nType information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the current scope, or type, with a special instance variable: @type. The type of this variable is TypeNode, which gives you access to type information at compile time.\nNote that @type is always the instance type, even when the macro is invoked in a class method.\nFor example:\nmacro add_describe_methods\n  def describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\n\n  def self.describe\n    \"Class is: \" + {{ @type.stringify }}\n  end\nend\n\nclass Foo\n  add_describe_methods\nend\n\nFoo.new.describe # => \"Class is Foo\"\nFoo.describe # => \"Class is Foo\"\n\nMethod information\nWhen a macro is invoked you can access the method, the macro is in with a special instance variable: @def. The type of this variable is Def unless the macro is outside of a method, in this case it's NilLiteral.\nExample:\nmodule Foo\n  def Foo.boo(arg1, arg2)\n    {% @def.receiver %} # => Foo\n    {% @def.name %}     # => boo\n    {% @def.args %}     # => [arg1, arg2]\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.boo(0, 1)\n\nConstants\nMacros can access constants. For example:\nVALUES = [1, 2, 3]\n\n{% for value in VALUES %}\n  puts {{value}}\n{% end %}\n\nIf the constant denotes a type, you get back a TypeNode.\nNested macros\nIt is possible to define a macro which generates one or more macro definitions. You must escape macro expressions of the inner macro by preceding them with a backslash character \"\\\" to prevent them from being evaluated by the outer macro.\nmacro define_macros(*names)\n  {% for name in names %}\n    macro greeting_for_{{name.id}}(greeting)\n      \\{% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n        \"¡hola {{name.id}}!\"\n      \\{% else %}\n        \"\\{{greeting.id}} {{name.id}}\"\n      \\{% end %}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#\n#     macro greeting_for_alice\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola alice!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} alice\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\n#     macro greeting_for_bob\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola bob!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} bob\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\ndefine_macros alice, bob\n\ngreeting_for_alice \"hello\"  # => \"hello alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hallo\"    # => \"hallo bob\"\ngreeting_for_alice \"hej\"    # => \"hej alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hola\"     # => \"¡hola bob!\"\n\nverbatim\nAnother way to define a nested macro is by using the special verbatim call. Using this you will not be able to use any variable interpolation but will not need to escape the inner macro characters.\nmacro define_macros(*names)\n  {% for name in names %}\n    macro greeting_for_{{name.id}}(greeting)\n\n      # name will not be available within the verbatim block\n      \\{% name = {{name.stringify}} %}\n\n      {% verbatim do %}\n        {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n          \"¡hola {{name.id}}!\"\n        {% else %}\n          \"{{greeting.id}} {{name.id}}\"\n        {% end %}\n      {% end %}\n    end\n  {% end %}\nend\n\n# This generates:\n#\n#     macro greeting_for_alice\n#       {% name = \"alice\" %}\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola alice!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} alice\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\n#     macro greeting_for_bob\n#       {% name = \"bob\" %}\n#       {% if greeting == \"hola\" %}\n#         \"¡hola bob!\"\n#       {% else %}\n#         \"{{greeting.id}} bob\"\n#       {% end %}\n#     end\ndefine_macros alice, bob\n\ngreeting_for_alice \"hello\"  # => \"hello alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hallo\"    # => \"hallo bob\"\ngreeting_for_alice \"hej\"    # => \"hej alice\"\ngreeting_for_bob \"hola\"     # => \"¡hola bob!\"\n\nNotice the variables in the inner macro are not available within the verbatim block. The contents of the block are transferred \"as is\", essentially as a string, until re-examined by the compiler.\nComments\nMacro expressions are evaluated both within comments as well as compilable sections of code. This may be used to provide relevant documentation for expansions:\n{% for name, index in [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] %}\n  # Provides a placeholder {{name.id}} method. Always returns {{index}}.\n  def {{name.id}}\n    {{index}}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\nThis evaluation applies to both interpolation and directives. As a result of this, macros cannot be commented out.\nmacro a\n  # {% if false %}\n  puts 42\n  # {% end %}\nend\n\na\n\nThe expression above will result in no output.\nPitfalls\nWhen writing macros (especially outside of a macro definition) it is important to remember that the generated code from the macro must be valid Crystal code by itself even before it is merged into the main program's code. This means, for example, a macro cannot generate a one or more when expressions of a case statement unless case was a part of the generated code.\nHere is an example of such an invalid macro:\ncase 42\n{% for klass in [Int32, String] %}\n  when {{klass.id}}\n    p \"is {{klass}}\"\n{% end %}\nend\n\nNotice that case is not within the macro. The code generated by the macro consists solely of two when expressions which, by themselves, is not valid Crystal code. We must include case within the macro in order to make it valid by using begin and end:\n{% begin %}\n  case 42\n  {% for klass in [Int32, String] %}\n    when {{klass.id}}\n      p \"is {{klass}}\"\n  {% end %}\n  end\n{% end %}\n\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/macros/macro_methods.html","title":"Macro methods","keywords":"","body":"Macro methods\nMacro defs allow you to define a method for a class hierarchy which is then instantiated for each concrete subtype.\nA def is implicitly considered a macro def if it contains a macro expression which refers to @type.

This custom data is then sent as an argument to the callback. For example, suppose a C function that invokes a callback at every tick, passing that tick:\nlib LibTicker\n  fun on_tick(callback : (Int32, Void* ->), data : Void*)\nend\n\nTo properly define a wrapper for this function we must send the Proc as the callback data, and then convert that callback data to the Proc and finally invoke it.\nmodule Ticker\n  # The callback for the user doesn't have a Void*\n  @@box : Pointer(Void)?\n\n  def self.on_tick(&callback : Int32 ->)\n    # Since Proc is a {Void*, Void*}, we can't turn that into a Void*, so we\n    # \"box\" it: we allocate memory and store the Proc there\n    boxed_data = Box.box(callback)\n\n    # We must save this in Crystal-land so the GC doesn't collect it (*)\n    @@box = boxed_data\n\n    # We pass a callback that doesn't form a closure, and pass the boxed_data as\n    # the callback data\n    LibTicker.on_tick(->(tick, data) {\n      # Now we turn data back into the Proc, using Box.unbox\n      data_as_callback = Box(typeof(callback)).unbox(data)\n      # And finally invoke the user's callback\n      data_as_callback.call(tick)\n    }, boxed_data)\n  end\nend\n\nTicker.on_tick do |tick|\n  puts tick\nend\n\nNote that we save the boxed callback in @@box. The reason is that if we don't do it, and our code doesn't reference it anymore, the GC will collect it. The C library will of course store the callback, but Crystal's GC has no way of knowing that.\nRaises attribute\nIf a C function executes a user-provided callback that might raise, it must be annotated with the @[Raises] attribute.\nThe compiler infers this attribute for a method if it invokes a method that is marked as @[Raises] or raises (recursively).\nHowever, some C functions accept callbacks to be executed by other C functions. For example, suppose a fictitious library:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nLibFoo.store_callback ->{ raise \"OH NO!\" }\nLibFoo.execute_callback\n\nIf the callback passed to store_callback raises, then execute_callback will raise. However, the compiler doesn't know that execute_callback can potentially raise because it is not marked as @[Raises] and the compiler has no way to figure this out. In these cases you have to manually mark such functions:\nlib LibFoo\n  fun store_callback(callback : ->)\n\n  @[Raises]\n  fun execute_callback\nend\n\nIf you don't mark them, begin/rescue blocks that surround this function's calls won't work as expected.\n"},"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html":{"url":"syntax_and_semantics/unsafe.html","title":"Unsafe code","keywords":"","body":"Unsafe code\nThese parts of the language are considered unsafe:\n\nCode involving raw pointers: the Pointer type and pointerof.\nThe allocate class method.\nCode involving C bindings\nUninitialized variable declaration\n\n\"Unsafe\" means that memory corruption, segmentation faults and crashes are possible to achieve.

It represents the runway through which statements travel from our application to the database.\nIn Crystal we have two ways of building this connection. And so, coming up next, we are going to present examples with some advice on when to use each one.\nDB module\n\nGive me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.Archimedes\n\nThe DB module, is our place to stand when working with databases in Crystal. As written in the documentation: is a unified interface for database access.\nOne of the methods implemented in this module is DB#connect. Using this method is the first way for creating a connection. Let's see how to use it.\nDB#connect\nWhen using DB#connect we are indeed opening a connection to the database. The uri passed as the parameter is used by the module to determine which driver to use (for example: mysql://, postgres://, sqlite://, etc.) i.e. we do not need to specify which database we are using.\nThe uri for this example is mysql://root:root@localhost/test, and so the module will use the mysql driver to connect to the MySQL database.\nHere is the example:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\ncnn = DB.connect(\"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\")\nputs typeof(cnn) # => DB::Connection\ncnn.close\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the method returns a DB::Connection object. Although more specifically, it returns a MySql::Connection object, it doesn't matter because all types of connections should be polymorphic. So hereinafter we will work with a DB::Connection instance, helping us to abstract from specific issues of each database engine.\nWhen creating a connection manually (as we are doing here) we are responsible for managing this resource, and so we must close the connection when we are done using it. Regarding the latter, this little details can be the cause of huge bugs! Crystal, being a language for humans, give us a more safe way of manually creating a connection using blocks, like this:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.connect \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\", do |cnn|\n  puts typeof(cnn) # => DB::Connection\nend # the connection will be closed here\n\nOk, now we have a connection, let's use it!\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.connect \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\", do |cnn|\n  puts typeof(cnn) # => DB::Connection\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\n\n  result = cnn.exec(\"drop table if exists contacts\")\n  puts result\n\n  result = cnn.exec(\"create table contacts (name varchar(30), age int)\")\n  puts result\n\n  cnn.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn2 = tx.connection\n    puts \"Yep, it is the same connection! #{cnn == cnn2}\"\n\n    cnn2.exec(\"insert into contacts values ('Joe', 42)\")\n    cnn2.exec(\"insert into contacts values (?, ?)\", \"Sarah\", 43)\n  end\n\n  cnn.query_each \"select * from contacts\" do |rs|\n    puts \"name: #{rs.read}, age: #{rs.read}\"\n  end\nend\n\nFirst, in this example, we are using a transaction (check the transactions section for more information on this topic)\nSecond, it's important to notice that the connection given by the transaction is the same connection that we were working with, before the transaction begin. That is, there is only one connection at all times in our program.\nAnd last, we are using the method #exec and #query. You may read more about executing queries in the database section.\nNow that we have a good idea about creating a connection, let's present the second way for creating one: DB#open\nDB#open\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\ndb = DB.open(\"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\")\nputs typeof(db) # DB::Database\ndb.close\n\nAs with a connection, we should close the database once we don't need it anymore.\nOr instead, we could use a block and let Crystal close the database for us!\nBut, where is the connection?\nWell, we should be asking for the connections. When a database is created, a pool of connections is created with connections to the database prepared and ready to use! (Do you want to read more about pool of connections? In the connection pool section you may read all about this interesting topic!)\nHow do we use a connection from the database object?\nFor this, we could ask the database for a connection using the method Database#checkout. But, doing this will require to explicitly return the connection to the pool using Connection#release. Here is an example:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  cnn = db.checkout\n  puts typeof(cnn)\n\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\n  cnn.release\n  puts \"Connection closed: #{cnn.closed?}\" # => false\nend\n\nAnd we want a safe way (i.e. no need for us to release the connection) to request and use a connection from the database, we could use Database#using_connection:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  db.using_connection do |cnn|\n    puts typeof(cnn)\n    # use cnn\n  end\nend\n\nIn the next example we will let the database object to manage the connections by itself, like this:\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nDB.open \"mysql://root:root@localhost/test\" do |db|\n  db.exec(\"drop table if exists contacts\")\n  db.exec(\"create table contacts (name varchar(30), age int)\")\n\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n    cnn.exec(\"insert into contacts values ('Joe', 42)\")\n    cnn.exec(\"insert into contacts values (?, ?)\", \"Sarah\", 43)\n  end\n\n  db.query_each \"select * from contacts\" do |rs|\n    puts \"name: #{rs.read}, age: #{rs.read}\"\n  end\nend\n\nAs we may notice, the database is polymorphic with a connection object with regard to the #exec / #query / #transaction methods. The database is responsible for the use of the connections. Great!\nWhen to use one or the other?\nGiven the examples, it may come to our attention that the number of connections is relevant.\nIf we are programming a short living application with only one user starting requests to the  database then a single connection managed by us (i.e. a DB::Connection object) should be enough (think of a command line application that receives parameters, then starts a request to the database and finally displays the result to the user)\nOn the other hand, if we are building a system with many concurrent users and with heavy database access, then we should use a DB::Database object; which by using a connection pool will have a number of connections already prepared and ready to use (no bootstrap/initialization-time penalizations). Or imagine that you are building a long-living application (like a background job) then a connection pool will free you from the responsibility of monitoring the state of the connection: is it alive or does it need to reconnect?\n"},"database/connection_pool.html":{"url":"database/connection_pool.html","title":"Connection pool","keywords":"","body":"Connection pool\nWhen a connection is established it usually means opening a TCP connection or Socket. The socket will handle one statement at a time. If a program needs to perform many queries simultaneously, or if it handles concurrent requests that aim to use a database, it will need more than one active connection.\nSince databases are separate services from the application using them, the connections might go down, the services might be restarted, and other sort of things the program might not want to care about.\nTo address this issues usually a connection pool is a neat solution.\nWhen a database is opened with crystal-db there is already a connection pool working. DB.open returns a DB::Database object which manages the whole connection pool and not just a single connection.\nDB.open(\"mysql://root@localhost/test\") do |db|\n  # db is a DB::Database\nend\n\nWhen executing statements using db.query, db.exec, db.scalar, etc. the algorithm goes:\n\nFind an available connection in the pool.\nCreate one if needed and possible.\nIf the pool is not allowed to create a new connection, wait a for a connection to become available.\nBut this wait should be aborted if it takes too long.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout that connection from the pool.\nExecute the SQL command.\nIf there is no DB::ResultSet yielded, return the connection to the pool. Otherwise, the connection will be returned to the pool when the ResultSet is closed.\nReturn the statement result.\n\nIf a connection can't be created, or if a connection loss occurs while the statement is performed the above process is repeated.\n\nThe retry logic only happens when the statement is sent through the DB::Database . If it is sent through a DB::Connection or DB::Transaction no retry is performed since the code will state that certain connection object was expected to be used.\n\nConfiguration\nThe behavior of the pool can be configured from a set of parameters that can appear as query string in the connection URI.\n\n\n\nName\nDefault value\n\n\n\n\ninitial_pool_size\n1\n\n\nmax_pool_size\n0 (unlimited)\n\n\nmax_idle_pool_size\n1\n\n\ncheckout_timeout\n5.0 (seconds)\n\n\nretry_attempts\n1\n\n\nretry_delay\n1.0 (seconds)\n\n\n\nWhen DB::Database is opened an initial number of initial_pool_size connections will be created. The pool will never hold more than max_pool_size connections.

For example, John transfers $50 to Sarah\nWe have two accounts (each represented by a name and an amount of money).\ndeposit db, \"Sarah\", 50\nwithdraw db, \"John\", 50\n\nIt is important to have in mind that if one of the operations fails then the final state would be inconsistent. So we need to execute the two operations (deposit and withdraw) as one operation. And if an error occurs then we would like to go back in time as if that one operation was never executed.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\ndb.transaction do |tx|\n  cnn = tx.connection\n\n  transfer_amount = 1000\n  deposit cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount\n  withdraw cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount\nend\n\nIn the above example, we start a transaction simply by calling the method Database#transaction (how we get the database object is encapsulated in the method get_bank_db and is out of the scope of this document).\nThe block is the body of the transaction. When the block gets executed (without any error) then an implicit commit is finally executed to persist the changes in the database.\nIf an exception is raised by one of the operations, then an implicit rollback is executed, bringing the database to the state before the transaction started.\nException handling and rolling back\nAs we mentioned early, an implicit rollback gets executed when an exception is raised, and it’s worth mentioning that the exception may be rescued by us.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 1000\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    # John does not have enough money in his account!\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Transfer has been rolled back due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nWe may also raise an exception in the body of the transaction:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n    raise Exception.new \"Because ...\"\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Transfer has been rolled back due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nAs the previous example, the exception cause the transaction to rollback and then is rescued by us.\nThere is one exception with a different behaviour. If a DB::Rollback is raised within the block, the implicit rollback will happen, but the exception will not be raised outside the block.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    # rollback exception\n    raise DB::Rollback.new\n  end\nrescue ex\n  # ex is never a DB::Rollback\nend\n\nExplicit commit and rollback\nIn all the previous examples, the rolling back is implicit, but we can also tell the transaction to rollback:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |tx|\n    cnn = tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    tx.rollback\n\n    puts \"Rolling Back the changes!\"\n  end\nrescue ex\n  # Notice that no exception is used in this case.\nend\n\nAnd we can also use the commit method:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ndb.transaction do |tx|\n  cnn = tx.connection\n\n  transfer_amount = 50\n  deposit(cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n  withdraw(cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n  tx.commit\nend\n\nNOTE: After commit or rollback are used, the transaction is no longer usable. The connection is still open but any statement will be performed outside the context of the terminated transaction.\nNested transactions\nAs the name suggests, a nested transaction is a transaction created inside the scope of another transaction. Here is an example:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nSome observations from the above example:\nthe inner_tx works with the values updated although the outer_tx is pending the commit.\nThe connection used by outer_tx and inner_tx is the same connection. This is because the inner_tx inherits the connection from the outer_tx when created.\nRollback nested transactions\nAs we’ve already seen, a rollback may be fired at any time (by an exception or by sending the message rollback explicitly)\nSo let’s present an example with a rollback fired by an exception placed at the outer-transaction:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n    end\n\n    raise Exception.new(\"Rollback all the things!\")\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThe rollback place in the outer_tx block, rolled back all the changes including the ones in the inner_tx block (the same happens if we use an explicit rollback).\nIf the rollback is fired by an exception at the inner_tx block all the changes including the ones in the outer_tx are rollbacked.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      raise Exception.new(\"Rollback all the things!\")\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThere is a way to rollback the changes in the inner-transaction but keep the ones in the outer-transaction. Use rollback in the inner_tx object. This will rollback only then inner-transaction. Here is the example:\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      inner_tx.rollback\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\nThe same happens if a DB::Rollback exception is raised in the inner-transaction block.\ndb = get_bank_db\n\ncreate_account db, \"John\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Sarah\", amount: 100\ncreate_account db, \"Jack\", amount: 0\n\nbegin\n  db.transaction do |outer_tx|\n    outer_cnn = outer_tx.connection\n\n    transfer_amount = 50\n    deposit(outer_cnn, \"Sarah\", transfer_amount)\n    withdraw(outer_cnn, \"John\", transfer_amount)\n\n    outer_tx.transaction do |inner_tx|\n      inner_cnn = inner_tx.connection\n\n      # John => 50 (pending commit)\n      # Sarah => 150 (pending commit)\n      # Jack => 0\n\n      another_transfer_amount = 150\n      deposit(inner_cnn, \"Jack\", another_transfer_amount)\n      withdraw(inner_cnn, \"Sarah\", another_transfer_amount)\n\n      # Rollback exception\n      raise DB::Rollback.new\n    end\n  end\nrescue ex\n  puts \"Exception raised due to: #{ex}\"\nend\n\n\nACID.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.\n\nHowever, if you are writing a program and you realize that writing a semantically equivalent, faster version involves just minor changes, you shouldn't miss that opportunity.\nAnd always be sure to profile your program to learn what its bottlenecks are. For profiling, on macOS you can use Instruments Time Profiler, which comes with XCode. On Linux, any program that can profile C/C++ programs, like perf or Callgrind, should work.\nMake sure to always profile programs by compiling or running them with the --release flag, which turns on optimizations.\nAvoiding memory allocations\nOne of the best optimizations you can do in a program is avoiding extra/useless memory allocation. A memory allocation happens when you create an instance of a class, which ends up allocating heap memory. Creating an instance of a struct uses stack memory and doesn't incur a performance penalty. If you don't know the difference between stack and heap memory, be sure to read this.\nAllocating heap memory is slow, and it puts more pressure on the Garbage Collector (GC) as it will later have to free that memory.\nThere are several ways to avoid heap memory allocations. The standard library is designed in a way to help you do that.\nDon't create intermediate strings when writing to an IO\nTo print a number to the standard output you write:\nputs 123\nIn many programming languages what will happen is that to_s, or a similar method for converting the object to its string representation, will be invoked, and then that string will be written to the standard output. This works, but it has a flaw: it creates an intermediate string, in heap memory, only to write it and then discard it. This, involves a heap memory allocation and gives a bit of work to the GC.\nIn Crystal, puts will invoke to_s(io) on the object, passing it the IO to which the string representation should be written.\nSo, you should never do this:\nputs 123.to_s\nas it will create an intermediate string. Always append an object directly to an IO.\nWhen writing custom types, always be sure to override to_s(io), not to_s, and avoid creating intermediate strings in that method. For example:\nclass MyClass\n  # Good\n  def to_s(io)\n    # appends \"1, 2\" to IO without creating intermediate strings\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    io \nThis philosophy of appending to an IO instead of returning an intermediate string results in better performance than handling intermediate strings. You should use this strategy in your API definitions too.\nLet's compare the times:\n# io_benchmark.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nio = IO::Memory.new\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"without to_s\") do\n    io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release io_benchmark.cr\nwithout to_s  77.11M ( 12.97ns) (± 1.05%)       fastest\n   with to_s  18.15M ( 55.09ns) (± 7.99%)  4.25× slower\nAlways remember that it's not just the time that has improved: memory usage is also decreased.\nUse string interpolation instead of concatenation\nSometimes you need to work directly with strings built from combining string literals with other values. You shouldn't just concatenate these strings with String#+(String) but rather use string interpolation which allows to embed expressions into a string literal: \"Hello, #{name}\" is better than \"Hello, \" +  name.to_s.\nInterpolated strings are transformed by the compiler to append to a string IO so that it automatically avoids intermediate strings. The example above translates to:\nString.build do |io|\n  io \nAvoid IO allocation for string building\nPrefer to use the dedicated String.build optimized for building strings, instead of creating an intermediate IO::Memory allocation.\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nBenchmark.ips do |bm|\n  bm.report(\"String.build\") do\n    String.build do |io|\n      99.times do\n        io \nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release str_benchmark.cr\nString.build 597.57k (  1.67µs) (± 5.52%)       fastest\n  IO::Memory 423.82k (  2.36µs) (± 3.76%)  1.41× slower\nAvoid creating temporary objects over and over\nConsider this program:\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n  if [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n    lines_with_language_reference += 1\n  end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\nThe above program works but has a big performance problem: on every iteration a new array is created for [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]. Remember: an array literal is just syntax sugar for creating an instance of an array and adding some values to it, and this will happen over and over on each iteration.\nThere are two ways to solve this:\n\nUse a tuple. If you use {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"} in the above program it will work the same way, but since a tuple doesn't involve heap memory it will be faster, consume less memory, and give more chances for the compiler to optimize the program.\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"}.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\nMove the array to a constant.\nLANGS = [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if LANGS.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\n\nUsing tuples is the preferred way.\nExplicit array literals in loops is one way to create temporary objects, but these can also be created via method calls. For example Hash#keys will return a new array with the keys each time it's invoked. Instead of doing that, you can use Hash#each_key, Hash#has_key? and other methods.\nUse structs when possible\nIf you declare your type as a struct instead of a class, creating an instance of it will use stack memory, which is much cheaper than heap memory and doesn't put pressure on the GC.\nYou shouldn't always use a struct, though. Structs are passed by value, so if you pass one to a method and the method makes changes to it, the caller won't see those changes, so they can be bug-prone. The best thing to do is to only use structs with immutable objects, especially if they are small.\nFor example:\n# class_vs_struct.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nclass PointClass\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nstruct PointStruct\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"class\") { PointClass.new(1, 2) }\n  x.report(\"struct\") { PointStruct.new(1, 2) }\nend\n\nOutput:\n$ crystal run --release class_vs_struct.cr\n class  28.17M (± 2.86%) 15.29× slower\nstruct 430.82M (± 6.58%)       fastest\nIterating strings\nStrings in Crystal always contain UTF-8 encoded bytes. UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding: a character may be represented by several bytes, although characters in the ASCII range are always represented by a single byte. Because of this, indexing a string with String#[] is not an O(1) operation, as the bytes need to be decoded each time to find the character at the given position. There's an optimization that Crystal's String does here: if it knows all the characters in the string are ASCII, then String#[] can be implemented in O(1). However, this isn't generally true.\nFor this reason, iterating a String in this way is not optimal, and in fact has a complexity of O(n^2):\nstring = ...\nwhile i \nThere's a second problem with the above: computing the size of a String is also slow, because it's not simply the number of bytes in the string (the bytesize). However, once a String's size has been computed, it is cached.\nThe way to improve performance in this case is to either use one of the iteration methods (each_char, each_byte, each_codepoint), or use the more low-level Char::Reader struct. For example, using each_char:\nstring = ...\nstring.each_char do |char|\n  # ...\nend\n\n"},"guides/concurrency.html":{"url":"guides/concurrency.html","title":"Concurrency","keywords":"","body":"Concurrency\nConcurrency vs. Parallelism\nThe definitions of \"concurrency\" and \"parallelism\" sometimes get mixed up, but they are not the same.\nA concurrent system is one that can be in charge of many tasks, although not necessarily it is executing them at the same time. You can think of yourself being in the kitchen cooking: you chop an onion, put it to fry, and while it's being fried you chop a tomato, but you are not doing all of those things at the same time: you distribute your time between those tasks. Parallelism would be to stir fry onions with one hand while with the other one you chop a tomato.\nAt the moment of this writing, Crystal has concurrency support but not parallelism: several tasks can be executed, and a bit of time will be spent on each of these, but two code paths are never executed at the same exact time.\nA Crystal program executes in a single operating system thread, except the Garbage Collector (GC) which implements a concurrent mark-and-sweep (currently Boehm GC).\nFibers\nTo achieve concurrency, Crystal has fibers. A fiber is in a way similar to an operating system thread except that it's much more lightweight and its execution is managed internally by the process. So, a program will spawn multiple fibers and Crystal will make sure to execute them when the time is right.\nEvent loop\nFor everything I/O related there's an event loop. Some time-consuming operations are delegated to it, and while the event loop waits for that operation to finish the program can continue executing other fibers. A simple example of this is waiting for data to come through a socket.\nChannels\nCrystal has Channels inspired by CSP. They allow communicating data between fibers without sharing memory and without having to worry about locks, semaphores or other special structures.\nExecution of a program\nWhen a program starts, it fires up a main fiber that will execute your top-level code. There, one can spawn many other fibers. The components of a program are:\n\nThe Runtime Scheduler, in charge of executing all fibers when the time is right.\nThe Event Loop, which is just another fiber, being in charge of async tasks, like for example files, sockets, pipes, signals and timers (like doing a sleep).\nChannels, to communicate data between fibers. The Runtime Scheduler will coordinate fibers and channels for their communication.\nGarbage Collector: to clean up \"no longer used\" memory.\n\nA Fiber\nA fiber is an execution unit that is more lightweight than a thread. It's a small object that has an associated stack of 8MB, which is what is usually assigned to an operating system thread.\nFibers, unlike threads, are cooperative. Threads are pre-emptive: the operating system might interrupt a thread at any time and start executing another one. A fiber must explicitly tell the Runtime Scheduler to switch to another fiber. For example if there's I/O to be waited on, a fiber will tell the scheduler \"Look, I have to wait for this I/O to be available, you continue executing other fibers and come back to me when that I/O is ready\".\nThe advantage of being cooperative is that a lot of the overhead of doing a context switch (switching between threads) is gone.\nA Fiber is much more lightweight than a thread: even though it's assigned 8MB, it starts with a small stack of 4KB.\nOn a 64-bit machine it lets us spawn millions and millions of fibers. In a 32-bit machine we can only spawn 512 fibers, which is not a lot. But because 32-bit machines are starting to become obsolete, we'll bet on the future and focus more on 64-bit machines.\nThe Runtime Scheduler\nThe scheduler has a queue of:\n\nFibers ready to be executed: for example when you spawn a fiber, it's ready to be executed.\nThe event loop: which is another fiber. When there are no other fibers ready to be executed, the event loop checks if there is any async operation that is ready, and then executes the fiber waiting for that operation. The event loop is currently implemented with libevent, which is an abstraction of other event mechanisms like epoll and kqueue.\nFibers that voluntarily asked to wait: this is done with Fiber.yield, which means \"I can continue executing, but I'll give you some time to execute other fibers if you want\".\n\nCommunicating data\nBecause at this moment there's only a single thread executing your code, accessing and modifying a class variable in different fibers will work just fine. However, once multiple threads (parallelism) is introduced in the language, it might break. That's why the recommended mechanism to communicate data is using channels and sending messages between them. Internally, a channel implements all the locking mechanisms to avoid data races, but from the outside you use them as communication primitives, so you (the user) don't have to use locks.\nSample code\nSpawning a fiber\nTo spawn a fiber you use spawn with a block:\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  socket.gets\n  # ...\nend\n\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  sleep 5.seconds\n  #  ...\nend\n\nHere we have two fibers: one reads from a socket and the other does a sleep. When the first fiber reaches the socket.gets line, it gets suspended, the Event Loop is told to continue executing this fiber when there's data in the socket, and the program continues with the second fiber. This fiber wants to sleep for 5 seconds, so the Event Loop is told to continue with this fiber in 5 seconds. If there aren't other fibers to execute, the Event Loop will wait until either of these events happen, without consuming CPU time.\nThe reason why socket.gets and sleep behave like this is because their implementations talk directly with the Runtime Scheduler and the Event Loop, there's nothing magical about it. In general, the standard library already takes care of doing all of this so you don't have to.\nNote, however, that fibers don't get executed right away. For example:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nRunning the above code will produce no output and exit immediately.\nThe reason for this is that a fiber is not executed as soon as it is spawned. So, the main fiber, the one that spawns the above fiber, finishes its execution and the program exits.\nOne way to solve it is to do a sleep:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep 1.second\n\nThis program will now print \"Hello!\" for one second and then exit. This is because the sleep call will schedule the main fiber to be executed in a second, and then executes another \"ready to execute\" fiber, which in this case is the one above.\nAnother way is this:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nThis time Fiber.yield will tell the scheduler to execute the other fiber. This will print \"Hello!\" until the standard output blocks (the system call will tell us we have to wait until the output is ready), and then execution continues with the main fiber and the program exits. Here the standard output might never block so the program will continue executing forever.\nIf we want to execute the spawned fiber for ever, we can use sleep without arguments:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep\n\nOf course the above program can be written without spawn at all, just with a loop. sleep is more useful when spawning more than one fiber.\nSpawning a call\nYou can also spawn by passing a method call instead of a block. To understand why this is useful, let's look at this example:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThe above program prints \"10\" ten times. The problem is that there's only one variable i that all spawned fibers refer to, and when Fiber.yield is executed its value is 10.\nTo solve this, we can do this:\ni = 0\nwhile i (x : Int32) do\n    spawn do\n      puts(x)\n    end\n  end\n  proc.call(i)\n  i += 1\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nNow it works because we are creating a Proc and we invoke it passing i, so the value gets copied and now the spawned fiber receives a copy.\nTo avoid all this boilerplate, the standard library provides a spawn macro that accepts a call expression and basically rewrites it to do the above. Using it, we end up with:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThis is mostly useful with local variables that change at iterations. This doesn't happen with block arguments. For example, this works as expected:\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    puts i\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nSpawning a fiber and waiting for it to complete\nWe can use a channel for this:\nchannel = Channel(Nil).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(nil)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before receive\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"After receive\"\n\nThis prints:\nBefore receive\nBefore send\nAfter receive\n\nFirst, the program spawns a fiber but doesn't execute it yet. When we invoke channel.receive, the main fiber blocks and execution continues with the spawned fiber. Then channel.send(nil) is invoked, and so execution continues at channel.receive, which was waiting for a value. Then the main fiber continues executing and finishes, so the program exits without giving the other fiber a chance to print \"After send\".\nIn the above example we used nil just to communicate that the fiber ended. We can also use channels to communicate values between fibers:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before first send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before second send\"\n  channel.send(2)\nend\n\nputs \"Before first receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1\n\nputs \"Before second receive\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2\n\nOutput:\nBefore first receive\nBefore first send\n1\nBefore second receive\nBefore second send\n2\n\nNote that when the program executes a receive, that fiber blocks and execution continues with the other fiber. When send is executed, execution continues with the fiber that was waiting on that channel.\nHere we are sending literal values, but the spawned fiber might compute this value by, for example, reading a file, or getting it from a socket. When this fiber will have to wait for I/O, other fibers will be able to continue executing code until I/O is ready, and finally when the value is ready and sent through the channel, the main fiber will receive it. For example:\nrequire \"socket\"\n\nchannel = Channel(String).new\n\nspawn do\n  server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080)\n  socket = server.accept\n  while line = socket.gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\nspawn do\n  while line = gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\n3.times do\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nThe above program spawns two fibers. The first one creates a TCPServer, accepts one connection and reads lines from it, sending them to the channel. There's a second fiber reading lines from standard input. The main fiber reads the first 3 messages sent to the channel, either from the socket or stdin, then the program exits. The gets calls will block the fibers and tell the Event Loop to continue from there if data comes.\nLikewise, we can wait for multiple fibers to complete execution, and gather their values:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    channel.send(i * 2)\n  end\nend\n\nsum = 0\n10.times do\n  sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90\n\nYou can, of course, use receive inside a spawned fiber:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before receive\"\n  puts channel.receive\n  puts \"After receive\"\nend\n\nputs \"Before yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"After yield\"\n\nOutput:\nBefore yield\nBefore send\nBefore receive\n1\nAfter receive\nAfter send\nAfter yield\n\nHere channel.send is executed first, but since there's no one waiting for a value (yet), execution continues in other fibers. The second fiber is executed, there's a value on the channel, it's obtained, and execution continues, first with the first fiber, then with the main fiber, because Fiber.yield puts a fiber at the end of the execution queue.\nBuffered channels\nThe above examples use unbuffered channels: when sending a value, if a fiber is waiting on that channel then execution continues on that fiber.\nWith a buffered channel, invoking send won't switch to another fiber unless the buffer is full:\n# A buffered channel of capacity 2\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new(2)\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Before send 1\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Before send 2\"\n  channel.send(2)\n  puts \"Before send 3\"\n  channel.send(3)\n  puts \"After send\"\nend\n\n3.times do |i|\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nOutput:\nBefore send 1\nBefore send 2\nBefore send 3\n1\n2\nAfter send\n3\nNote that the first 2 sends are executed without switching to another fiber. However, in the third send the channel's buffer is full, so execution goes to the main fiber. Here the two values are received and the channel is depleted. At the third receive the main fiber blocks and execution goes to the other fiber, which sends more values, finishes, etc.\n"},"guides/testing.html":{"url":"guides/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing Crystal Code\nCrystal comes with a fully-featured spec library in the Spec module. It provides a structure for writing executable examples of how your code should behave.\nInspired by Rspec, it includes a domain specific language (DSL) that allows you to write examples in a way similar to plain english.\nA basic spec looks something like this:\nrequire \"spec\"\n\ndescribe Array do\n  describe \"#size\" do\n    it \"correctly reports the number of elements in the Array\" do\n      [1, 2, 3].size.should eq 3\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe \"#empty?\" do\n    it \"is true when no elements are in the array\" do\n      ([] of Int32).empty?.should be_true\n    end\n\n    it \"is false if there are elements in the array\" do\n      [1].empty?.should be_false\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nAnatomy of a spec file\nTo use the spec module and DSL, you need to add require \"spec\" to your spec files. Many projects use a custom spec helper which organizes these includes.\nConcrete test cases are defined in it blocks. An optional (but strongly recommended) descriptive string states it's purpose and a block contains the main logic performing the test.\nTest cases that have been defined or outlined but are not yet expected to work can be defined using pending instead of it. They will not be run but show up in the spec report as pending.\nAn it block contains an example that should invoke the code to be tested and define what is expected of it. Each example can contain multiple expectations, but it should test only one specific behaviour.\nWhen spec is included, every object has the instance methods #should and #should_not. These methods are invoked on the value being tested with an expectation as argument. If the expectation is met, code execution continues. Otherwise the example has failed and other code in this block will not be executed.\nIn test files, specs are structured by example groups which are defined by describe and context sections. Typically a top level describe defines the outer unit (such as a class) to be tested by the spec. Further describe sections can be nested within the outer unit to specify smaller units under test (such as individual methods).\nFor unit tests, it is recommended to follow the conventions for method names: Outer describe is the name of the class, inner describe targets methods. Instance methods are prefixed with #, class methods with ..\nTo establish certain contexts - think empty array versus array with elements - the context method may be used to communicate this to the reader. It has a different name, but behaves exactly like describe.\ndescribe and context take a description as argument (which should usually be a string) and a block containing the individual specs or nested groupings.\nExpectations\nExpectations define if the value being tested (actual) matches a certain value or specific criteria.\nEquivalence, Identity and Type\nThere are methods to create expectations which test for equivalence (eq), identity (be), type (be_a), and nil (be_nil).\nNote that the identity expectation uses .same? which tests if #object_id are identical. This is only true if the expected value points to the same object instead of an equivalent one. This is only possible for reference types and won't work for value types like structs or numbers.\nactual.should eq(expected)    # passes if actual == expected\nactual.should be(expected)    # passes if actual.same?(expected)\nactual.should be_a(expected)  # passes if actual.is_a?(expected)\nactual.should be_nil          # passes if actual.nil?\n\nTruthiness\nactual.should be_true         # passes if actual == true\nactual.should be_false        # passes if actual == false\nactual.should be_truthy       # passes if actual is truthy (neither nil nor false nor Pointer.null)\nactual.should be_falsey       # passes if actual is falsey (nil, false or Pointer.null)\n\nComparisons\nactual.should be   expected  # passes if actual >  expected\nactual.should be >= expected  # passes if actual >= expected\n\nOther matchers\nactual.should be_close(expected, delta) # passes if actual is within delta of expected:\n                                        # (actual - expected).abs \nExpecting errors\nThese matchers run a block and pass if it raises a certain exception.\nexpect_raises(MyError) do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError.\nend\n\nexpect_raises(MyError, \"error message\") do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError\n  # and the error message contains \"error message\".\nend\n\nexpect_raises(MyError, /error \\w{7}/) do\n  # Passes if this block raises an exception of type MyError\n  # and the error message matches the regular expression.\nend\n\nThey return the rescued exception so it can be used for further expectations, for example to verify specific properties of the exception.\nFocusing on a group of specs\ndescribe, context and it blocks can be marked with focus: true, like this:\nit \"adds\", focus: true do\n  (2 + 2).should_not eq(5)\nend\n\nIf any such thing is marked with focus: true then only those examples will run.\nTagging specs\nTags can be used to group specs, allowing to only run a subset of specs when providing a --tag argument to the spec runner (see Using the compiler).\ndescribe, context and it blocks can be tagged, like this:\nit \"is slow\", tags: \"slow\" do\n  sleep 60\n  true.should be(true)\nend\n\nit \"is fast\", tags: \"fast\" do\n  true.should be(true)\nend\n\nTagging an example group (describe or context) extends to all of the contained examples.\nMultiple tags can be specified by giving an Enumerable, such as Array or Set.\nRunning specs\nThe Crystal compiler has a spec command with tools to constrain which examples get run and tailor the output. All specs of a project are compiled and executed through the command crystal spec.\nBy convention, specs live in the spec/ directory of a project. Spec files must end with _spec.cr to be recognizable as such by the compiler command.\nYou can compile and run specs from folder trees, individual files, or specific lines in a file. If the specified line is the beginning of a describe or context section, all specs inside that group are run.\nThe default formatter outputs the file and line style command for failing specs which makes it easy to rerun just this individual spec.\nYou can turn off colors with the switch --no-color.\nRandomizing order of specs\nSpecs, by default, run in the order defined, but can be run in a random order by passing --order random to crystal spec.\nSpecs run in random order will display a seed value upon completion. This seed value can be used to rerun the specs in that same order by passing the seed value to --order.\nExamples\n# Run all specs in files matching spec/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec\n\n# Run  all specs in files matching spec/**/*_spec.cr without colors\ncrystal spec --no-color\n\n# Run all specs in files matching spec/my/test/**/*_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/\n\n# Run all specs in spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\n\n# Run the spec or group defined in line 14 of spec/my/test/file_spec.cr\ncrystal spec spec/my/test/file_spec.cr:14\n\n# Run all specs tagged with \"fast\"\ncrystal spec --tag 'fast'\n\n# Run all specs not tagged with \"slow\"\ncrystal spec --tag '~slow'\n\nSpec helper\nMany projects use a custom spec helper file, usually named spec/spec_helper.cr.\nThis file is used to require spec and other includes like code from the project needed for every spec file. This is also a good place to define global helper methods that make writing specs easier and avoid code duplication.\n# spec/spec_helper.cr\nrequire \"spec\"\nrequire \"../src/my_project.cr\"\n\ndef create_test_object(name)\n  project = MyProject.new(option: false)\n  object = project.create_object(name)\n  object\nend\n\n# spec/my_project_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\n\ndescribe \"MyProject::Object\" do\n  it \"is created\" do\n    object = create_test_object(name)\n    object.should_not be_nil\n  end\nend\n\n"},"guides/writing_shards.html":{"url":"guides/writing_shards.html","title":"Writing Shards","keywords":"","body":"Writing Shards\nHow to write and release Crystal Shards.\nWhat's a Shard?\nSimply put, a Shard is a package of Crystal code, made to be shared-with and used-by other projects.\nSee the Shards command for details.\nIntroduction\nIn this tutorial, we'll be making a Crystal library called palindrome-example.\n\nFor those who don't know, a palindrome is a word which is spelled the same way forwards as it is backwards. e.g. racecar, mom, dad, kayak, madam\n\nRequirements\nIn order to release a Crystal Shard, and follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:\n\nA working installation of the Crystal compiler\nA working installation of Git\nA GitHub or GitLab account\n\nCreating the Project\nBegin by using the Crystal compiler's init lib command to create a Crystal library with the standard directory structure.\nIn your terminal: crystal init lib \ne.g.\n $  crystal init lib palindrome-example\n      create  palindrome-example/.gitignore\n      create  palindrome-example/.editorconfig\n      create  palindrome-example/LICENSE\n      create  palindrome-example/README.md\n      create  palindrome-example/.travis.yml\n      create  palindrome-example/shard.yml\n      create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/spec/spec_helper.cr\n      create  palindrome-example/spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\nInitialized empty Git repository in //.../palindrome-example/.git/\n\n...and cd into the directory:\ne.g.\ncd palindrome-example\n\nThen add & commit to start tracking the files with Git:\n $  git add -A\n $  git commit -am \"First Commit\"\n[master (root-commit) 77bad84] First Commit\n 10 files changed, 102 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .editorconfig\n create mode 100644 .gitignore\n create mode 100644 .travis.yml\n create mode 100644 LICENSE\n create mode 100644 README.md\n create mode 100644 shard.yml\n create mode 100644 spec/palindrome-example_spec.cr\n create mode 100644 spec/spec_helper.cr\n create mode 100644 src/palindrome-example.cr\n create mode 100644 src/palindrome-example/version.cr\n\nWriting the Code\nThe code you write is up to you, but how you write it impacts whether people want to use your library and/or help you maintain it.\nTesting the Code\n\nTest your code.

If the code is not formatted correctly, this will break the build just as failing tests would.\ne.g.\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal tool format --check\n\nCommit and push to GitHub.\nFollow these guidelines to get your repo up & running on Travis CI.\nOnce you're up and running, and the build is passing, the build badge will update in your README.\nHosting your docs on GitHub-Pages\nAdd the following script to your .travis.yml:\n  - crystal docs\n\nThis tells Travis CI to generate your documentation.\nNext, add the following lines to your .travis.yml.\n(Be sure to replace all instances of  accordingly)\ndeploy:\n  provider: pages\n  skip_cleanup: true\n  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN\n  project_name: \n  on:\n    branch: master\n  local_dir: docs\n\nSet the Environment Variable, GITHUB_TOKEN, with your personal access token.\nIf you've been following along, your .travis.yml file should look something like this:\nlanguage: crystal\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal docs\ndeploy:\n  provider: pages\n  skip_cleanup: true\n  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN\n  project_name: \n  on:\n    branch: master\n  local_dir: docs\n\nClick Here for the official documentation on deploying to GitHub-Pages with Travis CI.\n"},"guides/hosting/gitlab.html":{"url":"guides/hosting/gitlab.html","title":"Hosting on GitLab","keywords":"","body":"Hosting on GitLab\n\nGo ahead and delete the default travis.yml that comes with the project. We won't be needing it.\n\nAdd and commit everything:\n  $ git add -A && git commit -am \"shard complete\"\n\n\nCreate a GitLab project with the same name and description as specified in your shard.yml.\n\nAdd the remote: (Be sure to replace  and  accordingly)\n  $ git remote add origin https://gitlab.com//.git\n\n  or if you use SSH\n  $ git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:/.git\n\n\nPush it:\n  $ git push origin master\n\n\n\nPipelines\nNext, let's setup a GitLab Pipeline that can run our tests and build/deploy the docs when we push code to the repo.\nSimply, you can just add the following file to the root of the repo and name it .gitlab-ci.yml\nimage: \"crystallang/crystal:latest\"\n\nbefore_script:\n  - shards install\n\ncache:\n  paths:\n  - lib/\n\nspec & format:\n  script:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal tool format --check\n\npages:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n  - crystal docs -o public src/palindrome-example.cr\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n    - public\n  only:\n  - master\n\nThis creates two jobs. The first one is titled \"spec & format\" (you can use any name you like) and by default goes in the \"test\" stage of the pipeline. It just runs the array of commands in script on a brand new instance of the docker container specified by image. You'll probably want to lock that container to the version of crystal you're using (the one specified in your shard.yml) but for this example we'll just use the latest tag.\nThe test stage of the pipeline will either pass (each element of the array returned a healthy exit code) or it will fail (one of the elements returned an error).\nIf it passes, then the pipeline will move onto the second job we defined here which we must name \"pages\". This is a special job just for deploying content to your gitlab pages site! This one is executed after tests have passed because we specified that it should occur in the \"deploy\" stage. It again runs the commands in script (this time building the docs), but this time we tell it to preserve the path public (where we stashed the docs) as an artifact of the job.\nThe result of naming this job pages and putting our docs in the public directory and specifying it as an artifact is that GitLab will deploy the site in that directory to the default URL https://.gitlab.io/.\nThe before_script and cache keys in the file are for running the same script in every job (shards install) and for hanging onto the files that were created (cache). They're not necessary if your shard doesn't have any dependencies.\nIf you commit the above file to your project and push, you'll trigger your first run of the new pipeline.\n$ git add -A && git commit -am 'Add .gitlab-ci.yml' && git push origin master\n\nSome Badges\nWhile that pipeline is running, let's attach some badges to the project to show off our docs and the (hopefully) successful state of our pipeline. (You might want to read the badges docs.)\nA badge is just a link with an image. So let's create a link to our pipeline and fetch a badge image from the Gitlab Pipeline Badges API.\nIn the Badges section of the General settings, we'll first add a release badge. The link is: https://gitlab.com///pipelines and the Badge Image URL is: https://gitlab.com///badges/master/pipeline.svg.\nAnd now if the pipleline has finished we'll have docs and we can link to them with a generic badge from shields.io.\n\nLink: https://.gitlab.io/\nImage: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-available-brightgreen.svg\n\nReleases\nA release is just a special commit in your history with a name (see tagging).\nAccording to the Crystal Shards README,\n\nWhen libraries are installed from Git repositories, the repository is expected to have version tags following a semver-like format, prefixed with a v. Examples: v1.2.3, v2.0.0-rc1 or v2017.04.1\n\nGitLab also has a releases feature that let's you associate files and a description with this tag. That way you can (for example) distribute binaries.\nAs you'll see from the releases docs, you can either create an annotated tag along with release notes/files in the UI:\n\nor you can create the tag from the command line like so:\n    $ git tag -a v0.1.0 -m \"Release v0.1.0\"\n\npush it up\n    $ git push origin master --follow-tags\n\nand then use the UI to add/edit the release note and attach files.\nBest Practices\n\nUse the -a option to create an annotated tag for releases.\nFollow Semantic Versioning.\n\nRelease Badge\nIf you'd like you can also add a shields.io badge for the release. GitLab doesn't have full support for this kind of thing, and until someone adds a version badge for gitlab to shields.io, we'll have to just code in the version number in the URLs directly.\n\nLink: https://img.shields.io/badge/release--brightgreen.svg\nImage: https://img.shields.io/badge/release--brightgreen.svg\n\nwhere  is the version number prefixed with a v like this: v0.1.0.\nMirror to GitHub\nAt the moment, crystalshards.xyz only uses the GitHub API, so if you want your library to be indexed on that service you can set up a \"push mirror\" from GitLab to GitHub.\n\nCreate a GitHub repository with the same name as your project.\nFollow the instructions here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/repository_mirroring.html#setting-up-a-push-mirror-from-gitlab-to-github-core\nEdit your GitHub description. The first few words of this description will show up in the search results of crystalshards.xyz but not the whole string, so for example, you could use the following\nDescription: Words that are the same forwards and backwards. This is a mirror of:\nLink: https://gitlab.com///\n\n\n\nThis is a push mirror and that means changes will only propagate one way. So be sure to let potential collaborators know that pull requests and issues should be submitted to your GitLab project.\n"},"guides/continuous_integration.html":{"url":"guides/continuous_integration.html","title":"Continuous Integration","keywords":"","body":"Continuous Integration\nThe ability of having immediate feedback on what we are working should be one of the most important characteristics in software development. Imagine making one change to our source code and having to wait 2 weeks to see if it broke something? oh! That would be a nightmare! For this, Continuous Integration will help a team to have immediate and frequent feedback about the status of what they are building.\nMartin Fowler defines Continuous Integration as\na software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.\nIn the next subsections, we are going to present 2 continuous integration tools: Travis CI and Circle CI and use them with a Crystal example application.\nThese tools not only will let us build and test our code each time the source has changed but also deploy the result (if the build was successful) or use automatic builds, and maybe test against different platforms, to mention a few.\nThe example application\nWe are going to use Conway's Game of Life as the example application. More precisely, we are going to use only the first iterations in Conway's Game of Life Kata solution using TDD.\nNote that we won't be using TDD in the example itself, but we will mimic as if the example code is the result of the first iterations.\nAnother important thing to mention is that we are using crystal init to create the application.\nAnd here's the implementation:\n# src/game_of_life.cr\nclass Location\n  getter x : Int32\n  getter y : Int32\n\n  def self.random\n    Location.new(Random.rand(10), Random.rand(10))\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@x, @y)\n  end\nend\n\nclass World\n  @living_cells : Array(Location)\n\n  def self.empty\n    new\n  end\n\n  def initialize(living_cells = [] of Location)\n    @living_cells = living_cells\n  end\n\n  def set_living_at(a_location)\n    @living_cells \nAnd the specs:\n# spec/game_of_life_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\n\ndescribe \"a new world\" do\n  it \"should be empty\" do\n    world = World.new\n    world.is_empty?.should be_true\n  end\nend\n\ndescribe \"an empty world\" do\n  it \"should not be empty after adding a cell\" do\n    world = World.empty\n    world.set_living_at(Location.random)\n    world.is_empty?.should be_false\n  end\nend\n\nAnd this is all we need for our continuous integration examples! Let's start!\nContinuous Integration step by step\nHere's the list of items we want to achieve:\n\nBuild and run specs using 3 different Crystal's versions:\nlatest\nnightly\n0.31.1 (using a Docker image)\n\n\nInstall shards packages\nInstall binary dependencies\nUse a database (for example MySQL)\nCache dependencies to make the build run faster\n\nFrom here choose your next steps:\n\nI want to use Travis CI\nI want to use Circle CI (coming soon...)\n\n"},"guides/ci/travis.html":{"url":"guides/ci/travis.html","title":"Using TravisCI","keywords":"","body":"Travis CI\nIn this section we are going to use Travis CI as our continuous-integration service. Travis CI is mostly used for building and running tests for projects hosted at GitHub. It supports different programming laguages and for our particular case, it supports the Crystal language.\n\nNote:If you are new to continuous integration (or you want to refresh the basic concepts) we may start reading the core concepts guide.\n\nNow let's see some examples!\nBuild and run specs\nUsing latest and nightly\nA first (and very basic) Travis CI config file could be:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\n\nThat's it! With this config file, Travis CI by default will run crystal spec.\nNow, we just need to go to Travis CI dashboard to add the GitHub repository.\nLet's see another example:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\n\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n  - nightly\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n  - crystal tool format --check\n\nWith this configuration, Travis CI will run the tests using both Crystal latest and nightly releases on every push to a branch on your Github repository.\nNote: When creating a Crystal project using crystal init, Crystal creates a .travis.yml file for us.\nUsing a specific Crystal release\nLet's suppose we want to pin a specific Crystal release (maybe we want to make sure the shard compiles and works with that version) for example Crystal 0.31.1.\nTravis CI only provides runners to latest and nightly releases directly and so, we need to install the requested Crystal release manually. For this we are going to use Docker.\nFirst we need to add Docker as a service in .travis.yml, and then we can use docker commands in our build steps, like this:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: minimal\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nscript:\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nNote: We may read about different (languages)[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/] supported by Travis CI, included minimal.\nNote: A list with the different official Crystal docker images is available at DockerHub.\nUsing latest, nightly and a specific Crystal release all together!\nSupported runners can be combined with Docker-based runners using a Build Matrix. This will allow us to run tests against latest and nightly and pinned releases.\nHere is the example:\n# .travis.yml\nmatrix:\n include:\n   - language: crystal\n     crystal:\n       - latest\n     script:\n       - crystal spec\n\n   - language: crystal\n     crystal:\n       - nightly\n     script:\n       - crystal spec\n\n   - language: bash\n     services:\n       - docker\n     script:\n       - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nInstalling shards packages\nIn native runners (language: crystal), Travis CI already automatically installs shards dependencies using shards install. To improve build performance we may add caching on top of that.\nUsing Docker\nIn a Docker-based runner we need to run shards install explicitly, like this:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: bash\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nscript:\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 shards install\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src crystallang/crystal:0.31.1 crystal spec\n\nNote: Since the shards will be installed in ./lib/ folder, it will be preserved for the second docker run command.\nInstalling binary dependencies\nOur application or maybe some shards may required libraries and packages. This binary dependencies may be installed using different methods. Here we are going to show an example using the Apt command (since the Docker image we are using is based on Ubuntu)\nHere is a first example installing the libsqlite3 development package using the APT addon:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nbefore_install:\n  - sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-dev\n\naddons:\n  apt:\n    update: true\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nUsing Docker\nWe are going to build a new docker image based on crystallang/crystal, and in this new image we will be installing the binary dependencies.\nTo accomplish this we are going to use a Dockerfile:\n# Dockerfile\nFROM crystallang/crystal:latest\n\n# install binary dependencies:\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev\n\nAnd here is the Travis CI configuration file:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: bash\n\nservices:\n  - docker\n\nbefore_install:\n  # build image using Dockerfile:\n  - docker build -t testing .\n\nscript:\n  # run specs in the container\n  - docker run -v $PWD:/src -w /src testing crystal spec\n\nNote: Dockerfile arguments can be used to use the same Dockerfile for latest, nightly or a specific version.\nUsing services\nTravis CI may start services as requested.\nFor example, we can start a MySQL database service by adding a services: section to our .travis.yml:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nservices:\n  - mysql\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nHere is the new test file for testing against the database:\n# spec/simple_db_spec.cr\nrequire \"./spec_helper\"\nrequire \"mysql\"\n\nit \"connects to the database\" do\n  DB.connect ENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"] do |cnn|\n    cnn.query_one(\"SELECT 'foo'\", as: String).should eq \"foo\"\n  end\nend\n\nWhen pushing this changes Travis CI will report the following error: Unknown database 'test' (Exception), showing that we need to configure the MySQL service and also setup the database:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\nenv:\n  global:\n    - DATABASE_NAME=test\n    - DATABASE_URL=mysql://root@localhost/$DATABASE_NAME\n\nservices:\n  - mysql\n\nbefore_install:\n  - mysql -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $DATABASE_NAME;\"\n  - mysql -u root --password=\"\" $DATABASE_NAME \nWe are using a schema.sql script to create a more readable .travis.yml. The file ./db/schema.sql looks like this:\n-- schema.sql\nCREATE TABLE ... etc ...\n\nPushing these changes will trigger Travis CI and the build should be successful!\nCaching\nIf we read Travis CI job log, we will find that every time the job runs, Travis CI needs to fetch the libraries needed to run the application:\nFetching https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-mysql.git\nFetching https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db.git\n\nThis takes time and, on the other hand, these libraries might not change as often as our application, so it looks like we may cache them and save time.\nTravis CI uses caching to improve some parts of the building path. Here is the new configuration file with cache enabled:\n# .travis.yml\nlanguage: crystal\ncrystal:\n  - latest\n\ncache: shards\n\nscript:\n  - crystal spec\n\nLet's push these changes. Travis CI will run, and it will install dependencies, but then it will cache the shards cache folder which, usually, is ~/.cache/shards. The following runs will use the cached dependencies.\n"}}}
