# Crystal 编程语言

This is the language reference for the Crystal programming language.

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

* Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal).
* Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
* Compile to efficient native code.

**Crystal's standard library is documented in the [API docs](https://crystal-lang.org/api).**
